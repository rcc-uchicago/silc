16	NF	190.51	194.25	3.74		because without any atmosphere there's no insulation			
16	NF	194.57	196.48	1.91		so you can get cold really easily			mm-hmm
16	NF	197.2	203.01	5.81		astronauts could jump higher on the moon than they could on earth and they came down more slowly			
16	NF	203.27	204.73	1.46		it was almost like floating			He's got him like a soda or something, hmm
16	NF	206.25	207.27	1.02		why's that			
16	NF	207.45	209.24	1.79			cause there's no gravity		
16	NF	209.71	213.36	3.65		there's just less gravity because the moon is smaller than the earth			
16	NF	213.59	217.24	3.65		and the smaller the planet, the less gravity there is			
16	NF	217.28	220.14	2.86		so is there more gravity on jupiter or on earth			
16	NF	220.98	221.87	0.89			jupiter		
16	NF	221.89	222.8	0.91		definitely			
16	NF	222.56	223.54	0.98				page 10	
16	NF	223.39	225.13	1.74		cause it's so much bigger than the earth			
16	NF	226.2	228.98	2.78			so you can't jump on jupiter?		
16	NF	229.08	236.55	7.47		probably not, I think that if we were on jupiter, we would be crushed by the gravity			
16	NF	236.89	240.6	3.71		there'd be so much gravity we might not be able to peel ourselves up			
16	NF	241.177	241.877	0.7		although			
16	NF	243.147	245.927	2.78		jupiter is a great big gas planet giant			
16	NF	246.227	246.907	0.68			yeah		
16	NF	246.927	250.577	3.65		I think that it has, at the very center at its core it's solid			
16	NF	251.497	256.187	4.69		but most of it is gas, and it's not gases we can breathe either			
16	NF	257.747	259.717	1.97		so there's not really any place to stand			
16	NF	260.437	266.037	5.6		from the moon, the astronauts could see earth. the earth looked far away			
16	NF	271.097	273.307	2.21		what do you think about that picture of the earth			
16	NF	273.91	275.49	1.58		you can only see half of it			
16	NF	276.29	277.04	0.75			yeah		
16	NF	279.14	280.64	1.5		where's the other half?			
16	NF	282.3	284.21	1.91		it's in the shadow of the moon			
16	NF	284.21	285.39	1.18		yeah probably			
16	NF	288.01	290.11	2.1		amazing, why is it so blue			
16	NF	290.71	292.93	2.22			because there's so much water		
16	NF	292.43	295.39	2.96		there's so much water think about it, three quarters of the earth is water			
16	NF	293.97	294.83	0.86				page 11	
16	NF	295.29	295.8	0.51			yes		
16	NF	297.94	301.85	3.91		about every four weeks, the moon travels around earth			
16	NF	302.66	305.1	2.44		the sun shines on the moon and lights it up			
16	NF	306.86	308.34	1.48		here's the sun			
16	NF	309.44	315.31	5.87		and here's, it's showing you how the moon travels around the earth it orbits the earth			
16	NF	315.66	318.7	3.04		right and the sun always shines on the same side of it			
16	NF	319.46	323.04	3.58		as it goes around so we always see the same side of the moon in the sky			
16	NF	323.24	326.12	2.88		but what about when we were down in argentina			
16	NF	326.34	329.27	2.93		in the southern hemisphere, what's different about the moon down there			
16	NF	329.69	333.62	3.93			because the moon blocks the sun		
16	NF	334.62	339.32	4.7		will we still see that same side of the moon in south america as we do up here in north america?			
16	NF	339.44	343.71	4.27		so when we lived in buenos aires, we saw the same side of the moon			
16	NF	345.91	347.47	1.56		but it was upside down			
16	NF	347.66	348.39	0.73			yes		
16	NF	348.66	354.16	5.5		or at least it looked upside down compared to how it looks in the northern hemisphere			
16	NF	354.24	355.54	1.3		of the earth			
16	NF	355.2	356.33	1.13				page 12	
16	NF	358.02	359.19	1.17		or we could go back to			
16	NF	358.8	359.5	0.7				page 11	
16	NF	359.72	365.48	5.76		about every four weeks the moon travels around earth. the sun shines on the moon and lights it up			
16	NF	365.2	365.92	0.72				page 12	
16	NF	366.05	367.38	1.33		and that's why you can see it			
16	NF	368.19	371.46	3.27		when you see it as a bright circle, it's called a full moon			
16	NF	374.13	375.04	0.91				page 13	
16	NF	375.23	377.59	2.36		some nights, the moon is a half moon			
16	NF	381.55	382.56	1.01				page 14	
16	NF	383.27	385.64	2.37		other nights, the moon is a crescent moon			
16	NF	385.96	388.41	2.45		barely any of it is being lit up			
16	NF	390.11	390.98	0.87				page 15	
16	NF	391.52	395.33	3.81		now that you know more about the moon, would you still like to visit it?			
16	NF	398.87	400.92	2.05		you have to think about it, you're not quite so certain?			
16	NF	400.92	403.75	2.83		you think maybe, maybe someday you can			
16	NF	410.44	413.12	2.68		looks like she's trying on one of the astronaut's helmets			
16	NF	421.78	427.37	5.59			it's even bigger than her head it's like going down covering her neck		
16	NF	427.57	430.73	3.16			but ## neck off really like this		
16	NF	430.81	436.0	5.19		well let's look at the picture of the astronaut			
16	NF	436.08	437.81	1.73		wearing it on the moon			
16	NF	436.28	436.86	0.58				page 8	
16	NF	438.59	439.31	0.72		there he is			
16	NF	439.91	448.05	8.14		he's got extra flaps, over in here it is. it's pretty big, of course he's bigger than she is I think			
16	NF	443.2	443.81	0.61				page 7	
16	NF	448.28	452.28	4.0		because he's a grown man and she looks like a young girl			
16	NF	449.85	450.42	0.57				page 15	
16	NF	452.23	453.77	1.54			yeah she's a young girl		
16	NF	453.87	456.24	2.37		so I think that he's bigger than she is			
16	NF	457.29	462.18	4.89		and then, I bet his helmet doesn't fit really tightly around his neck anyway			
16	NF	457.57	458.24	0.67				page 7	
16	NF	464.3	467.13	2.83		that looks bigger than how I would expect his head to be			
16	NF	468.44	470.89	2.45			and look, look. she		
16	NF	468.65	469.37	0.72				page 15	
16	NF	472.77	476.7	3.93			she's holding it to this, to this side

16	NF	483.73	484.32	0.59			yeah		
16	NF	484.07	485.59	1.52		it's off to the side a little bit			
16	NF	488.12	488.95	0.83			and look		
16	NF	489.21	493.91	4.7			it's covering her, look even her neck is covered up		
16	NF	495.29	501.44	6.15			her, some of her, that's a lot too big for her

66	nf	204.2	205.2	1.1		No? Okay.			
66	nf	205.4	213.3	7.9		Since the moon has no air or water - you hear? No air and no water. 			
66	nf	211.8	214.5	2.7			Why no air and no water?		
66	nf	214.5	217.7	3.2		There are no plants or animals there.			
66	nf	217.7	218.9	1.2			Why?		
66	nf	218.9	224.6	5.7		Why? Because animals need water to...			
66	nf	224.5	225.8	1.3			Drink?		
66	nf	225.8	227.0	1.1		And air			
66	nf	227.0	228.0	1.1			Yeah, air.		
66	nf	227.9	228.8	0.9		For what?			
66	nf	228.9	232.1	3.2			So they can breathe.		
66	nf	232.1	236.0	3.9		So they can breathe. Yes, exactly, so they can breathe.			
66	nf	236.0	240.8	4.9		And since there is no air and no water, so no animals.			
66	nf	240.8	247.2	6.3		And no... people			
66	nf	247.1	248.6	1.5			People

66	nf	267.4	268.4	1.0		mm-hmm			
66	nf	268.3	269.3	0.9			Silver!		
66	nf	269.4	272.3	2.9		Yes ### like silver ###

66	nf	288.4	289.5	1.2			Yeah!		
66	nf	289.6	292.9	3.4		So there were some people that visited the moon. 			
66	nf	293.0	294.3	1.4		And they are called...			
66	nf	294.5	296.0	1.4			Spaceships		
66	nf	296.2	303.2	7.1		No, spaceships is the, the ship where the animal - where the a-astronauts use			
66	nf	303.3	305.6	2.3		The people are called the astronauts			
66	nf	305.6	309.0	3.4		they, oh see, they are over here.			
66	nf	305.9	307.2	1.3			the astronauts		
66	nf	306.1	307.0	0.9				Page 6

66	nf	332.8	333.8	1.0		mm-hmm			
66	nf	333.8	337.3	3.6		The first trip was in nineteen-sixty-nine.			
66	nf	337.4	340.5	3.1		the last was in nineteen seventy two.			
66	nf	340.7	350.2	9.6		That was long time ago. Nineteen-sixty-nine was, aah, forty-six years ago.			
66	nf	350.4	355.3	4.9			And aah, that one?		
66	nf	355.4	362.9	7.5		Nineteen-seventy two? That was forty...

66	nf	363.0	365.6	2.6		What?			
66	nf	365.5	366.9	1.4			Seventy!		
66	nf	366.5	367.9	1.4		Seventy?			
66	nf	370.4	371.1	0.7				Page 7	
66	nf	371.3	380.8	9.5		Each time, two astronauts stepped out - stepped onto the moon's surface.			
66	nf	380.9	382.2	1.3		You see?			
66	nf	381.8	382.8	1.0			Yeah!		
66	nf	384.3	390.5	6.2		They have this special helmet, yeah, that protects their head			
66	nf	390.2	391.1	0.9			Why?		
66	nf	391.3	397.9	6.6		Because there is no air so they, see they have over here equipment and they have air in there			
66	nf	397.1	400.0	2.9			I have some ###

66	nf	424.2	426.4	2.2		I don't know!			
66	nf	426.5	435.2	8.6		Maybe they're going down or up down from the spaceship to the moon, or maybe they're going up from the moon to the spaceship!			
66	nf	436.4	440.8	4.4			I think they're going up to the moon to the spaceship.		
66	nf	440.9	443.2	2.3		You think from the moon to the spaceship?			
66	nf	443.2	443.9	0.7			Yeah		
66	nf	443.9	444.5	0.6		Yeah			
66	nf	444.6	446.6	2.0		Okay let me read over here.			
66	nf	446.7	452.6	5.9		Astronauts wore spacesuits. See, they're called spacesuits.			
66	nf	452.9	454.1	1.2			Suits?		
66	nf	454.2	456.4	2.2		Space - suits			
66	nf	455.1	455.7	0.6			Suits		
66	nf	456.5	461.8	5.3		Yeah. Spacesuits gave astronauts air to breathe. Yeah?			
66	nf	463.6	464.0	0.5				Page 8	
66	nf	464.2	472.7	8.6		Astronauts could jump higher on the moon than they could on Earth. See, they're jumping!			
66	nf	472.5	473.3	0.8			Why?		
66	nf	473.3	474.7	1.5		Up and down!			
66	nf	474.7	475.8	1.1			Why they're jumping?		
66	nf	475.7	477.7	2.0		Why they're jumping?			
66	nf	477.7	478.3	0.6			Yeah		
66	nf	478.3	479.6	1.4		Maybe they like to jump			
66	nf	479.7	487.9	8.2		Because there is no - the gravity there is so much smaller.			
66	nf	488.0	495.7	7.8		Like over here the gravity, it keeps us on Earth. Over there you can jump really high and then go back.			
66	nf	495.8	497.0	1.3			###		
66	nf	497.0	498.6	1.6		Yeah, and then go back down.			
66	nf	498.6	499.2	0.6		mm-hmm			
66	nf	500.1	501.1	1.0			Read!		
66	nf	501.3	509.7	8.4		Astronauts could jump higher on the moon then they could on Earth and they came down more slowly.			
66	nf	509.8	513.2	3.4		It was almost like floating.			
66	nf	513.3	516.6	3.3		Yeah, almost like you're floating on the water.			
66	nf	516.7	520.0	3.3			But it's not water there!		
66	nf	518.7	519.3	0.5				Page 10	
66	nf	519.8	520.7	0.9		No, it's not.			
66	nf	520.8	521.6	0.8			What's that?		
66	nf	520.8	522.8	2.0		See? That is Earth.			
66	nf	522.9	526.5	3.6			That is Earth, where we live!		
66	nf	525.3	528.0	2.8		mm, that's where we live, yeah.			
66	nf	528.2	535.0	6.8		And see, it's blue. And maybe you cannot see green but it's also green and the moon,			
66	nf	535.1	537.5	2.4		You remember, over here?			
66	nf	536.7	537.3	0.6				Page 4	
66	nf	537.6	542.6	5.0		The moon is just silver, yeah? One color. Do you see how different the Earth is?			
66	nf	540.5	541.3	0.8				Page 10	
66	nf	542.5	543.2	0.7			Yeah!		
66	nf	543.3	551.9	8.6		Yeah, that's why there are ### humans, people,  yeah, animals, flowers, plants, yeah			
66	nf	549.5	554.2	4.7			Yeah. And aah, some pictures!		
66	nf	553.8	557.8	4.0		mm-hmm, 			
66	nf	554.3	557.0	2.7			And treasure sand!		
66	nf	557.1	559.8	2.7			Trees, coconuts		
66	nf	559.9	563.2	3.3			*laughing* I said coconuts!		
66	nf	562.6	565.3	2.7		Yeah I know you like coconuts, right?			
66	nf	564.7	566.0	1.4			I love to eat them.		
66	nf	565.7	566.9	1.2		I know			
66	nf	567.0	569.6	2.7			I love co-co-conuts 		
66	nf	569.3	573.8	4.5		From the moon, the astronauts could see Earth.			
66	nf	573.8	578.3	4.5		The Earth looked far away.			
66	nf	578.4	585.0	6.6		Yeah? Does it look like when you look at the moon from the Earth?			
66	nf	585.6	589.0	3.3		Yeah? Does it seem to be far away?			
66	nf	588.0	590.4	2.4			But I see leaves		
66	nf	590.3	592.0	1.8		You just see leaves?			
66	nf	591.9	592.5	0.6			Yeah		
66	nf	592.4	597.9	5.5		I know, over here right now through the window we see leaves, but when we drive in the car, you remember?			
66	nf	597.9	600.2	2.3		Or when we go outside, at night?			
66	nf	600.3	604.4	4.1		When we look at the moon? It's far away, yeah? It's very little.			
66	nf	604.5	606.6	2.1		Is it little?

92	nf	648.82	651.776	2.956		Up through the chimney into outer space and to the moon.		
92	nf	652.108	655.262	3.154		That's what he wanted to do when he looked at the moon.		
92	nf	655.391	658.244	2.853		Do you ever wish you could go to the moon? Or not really?

92	nf	692.422	697.313	4.891		Ok, when you look up at the moon, do you wish you could visit it?

92	nf	748.055	748.718	0.663				page 4
92	nf	748.897	756.655	7.758		Since the moon has no air or water, there are no plants or animals there.

92	nf	759.58	760.688	1.108		No grass.

92	nf	980.256	985.288	5.032		Well, the astronauts can see the Earth because of the sun.		
92	nf	985.465	989.029	3.564		But the sun only lights up part of the Earth.

92	nf	1050.458	1054.787	4.329		Actually, Virginia is in North America over here. This is South America.		
92	nf	1054.787	1056.313	1.526		This is where Brazil is.		
92	nf	1056.313	1058.751	2.438		This is where NAME's from, NAME.

92	nf	1080.236	1085.153	4.917		The sun shines on the moon and lights it up.

92	nf	1105.878	1110.819	4.941		Well let's find out. That's a really good question, right? What do we call it if it's just half a circle.

97	nf	207.797	215.567	7.77		Well, maybe there's some water, if he gets thirsty, but, since there's no air on the moon, what does he need to carry?		
97	nf	215.018	216.001	0.983			Air?	
97	nf	215.926	232.107	16.181		Right, to breathe. He carries oxygen to breathe. He carries oxygen so he can breathe. Because if he took that pack off, and he took the helmet off, he would choke, he would suffocate, because there would be no air for him to breathe. 		
97	nf	231.873	233.217	1.344			Oh

97	nf	257.807	276.25	18.443		That's because the gravity on the moon is different from the gravity on Earth. So when you jump up you fall down right away, you come down right away. But on the moon, you jump up, you go up up up, and you come down much more slowly.

108	nf	39.074	40.214	1.14				page 3
108	nf	40.544	47.394	6.85		You would also see big rings called craters. There would be rocks all around you.		
108	nf	47.999	50.929	2.93			One day I saw those ### rocks.	
108	nf	50.904	54.274	3.37		Yeah! There are probably ### rocks on the moon too.

108	nf	56.539	57.759	1.22				page 4
108	nf	57.429	58.429	1.0		No boulders?		
108	nf	58.709	64.589	5.88		Since the moon has no air or water, there are no plants or animals there.		
108	nf	66.879	68.579	1.7		Unless we go visit.		
108	nf	67.872	71.826	3.954			But, but pluto has water and air.	
108	nf	71.82	72.456	0.636		Does it?

108	nf	75.934	86.643	10.709		Has anybody ever visited the moon? Yes - twelve astronauts. Six American spaceships flew to the moon.		
108	nf	90.162	92.198	2.036		There's one right there, on it's way.		
108	nf	92.498	93.216	0.718				page 6

108	nf	118.133	123.46	5.327		Each time, two astronauts stepped onto the moon's surface.		
108	nf	123.888	128.943	5.055		Lookit, you can kinda see a picture of what they see reflected on their helmet like a mirror.

108	nf	129.591	131.901	2.31		What do you, what do you think they see.

108	nf	141.746	143.81	2.064		And at the Adler Planetarium.		
108	nf	144.119	150.157	6.038		Astronauts wore spacesuits. Spacesuits gave astronauts air to breathe.		
108	nf	150.51	152.561	2.051		'Cause there wasn't any on the moon.		
108	nf	152.908	154.933	2.025		I think it's in their pack.		
108	nf	154.876	155.876	1.0			Mm-hmm.	
108	nf	155.079	156.56	1.481				page 9
108	nf	156.141	164.47	8.329		Astronauts could jump higher on the moon than they could on Earth and they came down more slowly. It was almost like floating!		
108	nf	165.151	166.796	1.645		Do you see them floating?		
108	nf	166.592	167.352	0.76			Mmm.

108	nf	177.666	180.045	2.379		What do you think the blue parts are?		
108	nf	179.924	181.798	1.874			Water.	
108	nf	181.272	184.437	3.165		Yeah? What do you think the white parts are?		
108	nf	185.454	187.383	1.929			Where people live.	
108	nf	187.539	191.609	4.07		Yeah. Maybe in the colder parts of people, where people live.		
108	nf	190.988	192.382	1.394			The Antarctic!	
108	nf	192.008	193.927	1.919		yeah! Right.		
108	nf	193.563	194.947	1.384				page 11
108	nf	194.618	201.8	7.182		Aah about every four weeks, the moon travels around the Earth. And the sun shines on the moon and lights it up.		
108	nf	202.006	207.511	5.505		Look what happens when it goes around. Sometimes it's a full moon. Sometimes it's a new moon.		
108	nf	207.899	211.606	3.707		And sometimes I think it's just a half moon and a crescent moon.		
108	nf	212.126	214.328	2.202		Remember talking about waxing and waning?		
108	nf	214.943	216.044	1.101				page 12
108	nf	215.537	216.524	0.987		That's		
108	nf	216.1	217.252	1.152			Waning?	
108	nf	217.001	222.444	5.443		Waning is when it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller		
108	nf	221.612	224.776	3.164			Then the moon one was waning	
108	nf	224.988	229.254	4.266		Mm-hmm. Then if it starts waxing it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.		
108	nf	228.266	233.811	5.545			Remember I saw, I I I saw a full moon last time?	
108	nf	233.75	237.029	3.279		Yeah that night aah with NAME.

108	nf	241.317	245.963	4.646		That's why you can see it. When you see it as a bright circle, it's called a		
108	nf	245.773	247.647	1.874			Full moon!	
108	nf	246.917	248.221	1.304		Yeah.
