2	24	933.339	933.768	0.429			Researcher Out
2	24	934.04	935.42	1.38	Or an upside-down jellyfish

2	24	940.38	941.4	1.02	More than 8 legs		
2	24	940.5	941.88	1.38		This is a jellyfish	
2	24	941.55	942.58	1.03	That's a jellyfish		
2	24	942.62	943.58	0.96	I don't know what that is		
2	24	943.53	951.91	8.38		1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14	
2	24	951.59	953.16	1.57	So can it be a octopus?		
2	24	953.15	954.74	1.59		Actually it's 13	
2	24	955.45	956.75	1.3	So is that an octopus?		
2	24	957.37	957.88	0.51	Nope		
2	24	958.14	958.81	0.67	*laughing*		
2	24	958.63	960.57	1.94		'Cause it's 13, not 8	
2	24	960.54	961.33	0.79	That's right		
2	24	961.33	963.01	1.68		And this is an octopus	
2	24	962.41	963.82	1.41	Yep, that's an octopus		
2	24	964.95	965.85	0.9		That's a crab	
2	24	965.93	966.61	0.68	Uh-huh

2	24	979.32	980.03	0.71		Starfish	
2	24	979.9	981.38	1.48	This could just be		
2	24	983.18	984.33	1.15	Oh I don't know		
2	24	983.928	984.093	0.165			
2	24	985.04	985.65	0.61		Well	
2	24	987.04	989.59	2.55		Maybe when we're finished we can ask her	
2	24	989.38	990.78	1.4	Yeah, that's a good idea		
2	24	991.24	992.4	1.16	And what's this one there?

2	24	1000.15	1000.57	0.42		Yeah	
2	24	1000.78	1002.22	1.44	Can we mix up the pieces?		
2	24	1003.1	1004.66	1.56	We can make it a little trickier		
2	24	1008.38	1013.08	4.7		No, usually when I mix up pieces it isn't trickier at all	
2	24	1012.55	1013.51	0.96	*laughing*		
2	24	1013.69	1014.38	0.69	Okay		
2	24	1017.0	1022.92	5.92		But we're just mixing 'em up just in case if this one is a little tricky ###	
2	24	1022.68	1023.66	0.98	It might be		
2	24	1026.16	1029.89	3.73		It might, but I don't think so	
2	24	1031.4	1033.78	2.38		Plus, board puzzles are easy	
2	24	1033.97	1035.41	1.44	What's your hard puzzle?		
2	24	1035.76	1037.12	1.36	What's the hardest one you tried to do?		
2	24	1037.6	1038.73	1.13		mmm	
2	24	1038.47	1043.2	4.73	How about the Charlie Brown pumpkin one that we could never finish? *laughing*		
2	24	1041.01	1042.74	1.73		*laughing* yes	
2	24	1044.89	1048.72	3.83		Yes, that is definitely that one	
2	24	1048.29	1049.64	1.35	I couldn't even do that one		
2	24	1049.75	1050.52	0.77	We had to give up		
2	24	1051.0	1051.77	0.77	*laughing*		
2	24	1051.68	1055.63	3.95		And we had to give it back to grandma before we were even finished	
2	24	1055.42	1056.97	1.55	I know, maybe next year		
2	24	1055.99	1058.65	2.66		Because we would never be finished with it	
2	24	1057.77	1059.04	1.27	Next year you'll be five		
2	24	1059.38	1060.06	0.68	And then maybe		
2	24	1060.92	1062.23	1.31	You can help me more with it		
2	24	1061.04	1062.41	1.37		I'll be better	
2	24	1062.3	1063.31	1.01	Yeah *laughing*		
2	24	1067.54	1071.28	3.74		Every year I just keep getting better and better at puzzles	
2	24	1068.48	1069.56	1.08			
2	24	1070.76	1071.61	0.85	That's right

2	24	1084.67	1085.45	0.78		What's this?	
2	24	1086.11	1088.21	2.1	This looks like, do you remember what that's part of?		
2	24	1088.21	1088.89	0.68		Swordfish	
2	24	1088.74	1089.35	0.61	Mm-hmm

2	24	1110.2	1111.03	0.83	What is that		
2	24	1110.8	1111.87	1.07		It's the jellyfish	
2	24	1111.67	1112.46	0.79	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1115.7	1116.81	1.11		Ya'know, mom	
2	24	1116.24	1117.25	1.01			
2	24	1116.72	1117.65	0.93	*laughing* what		
2	24	1116.93	1118.41	1.48		Puzzles are easy	
2	24	1118.74	1119.98	1.24	Well, not all of 'em		
2	24	1120.98	1123.94	2.96	Even if they're easy they're fun to do, especially when you get a new one, right?		
2	24	1121.02	1121.86	0.84		Well	
2	24	1124.33	1124.95	0.62		Mm-hmm

2	24	1128.99	1129.57	0.58	Uh-huh		
2	24	1129.26	1131.77	2.51		That puzzle was fun to do, and it was new	
2	24	1131.97	1132.55	0.58	Yeah		
2	24	1132.5	1133.6	1.1		She said it was new	
2	24	1133.66	1134.24	0.58	Yeah		
2	24	1134.9	1138.94	4.04	And was it, so, she did the farm one, and what one did you do by yourself?		
2	24	1139.09	1139.78	0.69		mmm	
2	24	1140.25	1142.07	1.82		Let me think	
2	24	1143.27	1145.47	2.2		Umm	
2	24	1145.94	1147.32	1.38		Let me think	
2	24	1152.162	1153.845	1.683			
2	24	1153.67	1154.9	1.23	Do you know who that guy is?		
2	24	1156.79	1158.34	1.55	Think of your vitamins		
2	24	1156.93	1157.99	1.06			
2	24	1160.06	1162.12	2.06		Seahorse	
2	24	1161.57	1162.33	0.76	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1162.51	1166.23	3.72		And a starfish is my vitamin	
2	24	1166.04	1166.81	0.77	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1167.04	1170.72	3.68		Wait, am I putting my vitamins in this puzzle?	
2	24	1170.27	1172.07	1.8	*laughs* I think a few of 'em		
2	24	1173.55	1174.26	0.71		Yeah	
2	24	1174.4	1177.73	3.33		Because my vitamin is not a jellyfish	
2	24	1175.889	1177.044	1.155			
2	24	1179.22	1183.85	4.63		And I do not have a octopus vitamin	
2	24	1183.68	1184.36	0.68	That's true		
2	24	1185.459	1187.109	1.65			
2	24	1190.51	1191.51	1.0			
2	24	1193.67	1195.69	2.02		No no, I do not	
2	24	1195.14	1196.64	1.5	So what's that guy? That's the shark?		
2	24	1195.15	1196.11	0.96			
2	24	1196.5	1197.16	0.66		Shark	
2	24	1197.06	1197.61	0.55	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1198.34	1200.55	2.21		And my vitamin	
2	24	1200.22	1201.25	1.03

2	24	1203.41	1204.75	1.34		*laughing*	
2	24	1207.61	1209.61	2.0		Does this have a regular fish?	
2	24	1209.69	1212.08	2.39	It has a whole bunch. Do you see the shadows of them all?		
2	24	1212.89	1214.97	2.08	Kinda like on our shower curtain, there's all those		
2	24	1215.89	1216.84	0.95	Fish on it		
2	24	1216.56	1217.11	0.55		Yeah	
2	24	1219.52	1220.47	0.95			
2	24	1223.904	1224.069	0.165			
2	24	1227.44	1228.92	1.48	Is that guy a lobster or a crab?		
2	24	1230.77	1231.44	0.67		Crab	
2	24	1232.54	1234.04	1.5	What's, do you know the difference?		
2	24	1234.59	1238.84	4.25		Because lobsters sometimes go on land, I think	
2	24	1239.52	1240.97	1.45		Do they stay in the water	
2	24	1240.64	1243.42	2.78	I think they stay in the water, unless people catch them to eat them		
2	24	1255.89	1257.01	1.12	What's that part of?		
2	24	1257.4	1258.89	1.49		Jellyfish	
2	24	1258.11	1258.88	0.77	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1259.379	1260.336	0.957			
2	24	1259.75	1262.69	2.94		That's not my vitamin, That's my vitamin	
2	24	1261.79	1262.53	0.74	Mm-hmm		
2	24	1263.81	1265.79	1.98		And that's also my puzzle	
2	24	1265.83	1268.48	2.65	Mm-hmm. Oh yeah, you have a starfish puzzle		
2	24	1268.73	1270.33	1.6	Or a, seahorse puzzle, right?		
2	24	1270.2	1270.66	0.46		mmm	
2	24	1271.02	1272.01	0.99	One of those little ones		
2	24	1272.58	1273.56	0.98			
2	24	1276.3	1277.54	1.24		Where does this go?	
2	24	1277.6	1278.42	0.82	I don't know		
2	24	1278.12	1278.72	0.6		There?	
2	24	1279.4	1280.25	0.85	Does that look right?		
2	24	1279.48	1279.85	0.37		No	
2	24	1280.5	1282.23	1.73		That doesn't go there	
2	24	1283.08	1285.27	2.19		It goes, umm	
2	24	1283.55	1284.85	1.3	Maybe you have to wait		
2	24	1285.79	1287.87	2.08		Yeah, maybe I have to wait	
2	24	1288.24	1289.4	1.16		I'll wait	
2	24	1289.99	1290.93	0.94			
2	24	1291.04	1293.85	2.81		*singing*	
2	24	1294.09	1295.87	1.78	Do you know what these little things are called?		
2	24	1295.63	1296.1	0.47		What	
2	24	1296.21	1297.97	1.76	That, that stick to, um

2	24	1300.11	1301.35	1.24	Those are barnacles		
2	24	1301.93	1302.87	0.94		Barnacles?	
2	24	1302.49	1303.03	0.54	Uh-huh		
2	24	1303.27	1305.97	2.7	In one of our books we- It talks about Barnacles		
2	24	1307.2	1311.08	3.88	They kind of live. They're living things and they live, in the skin, I guess		
2	24	1315.3	1317.92	2.62		Is this swordfish killing the shark?	
2	24	1318.91	1321.02	2.11	Mmm, Does it look like it, or does it look like he's jumping up?		
2	24	1321.254	1322.739	1.485			
2	24	1321.72	1326.94	5.22		It looks like he might be jumping up so that he can try to catch the shark's fin	
2	24	1327.14	1327.73	0.59	Maybe		
2	24	1328.29	1330.19	1.9	The shark looks like he might be pretty fast		
2	24	1328.94	1329.98	1.04			
2	24	1330.38	1331.21	0.83	Swimming away

2	24	1340.99	1342.06	1.07	Now do you know where it is?		
2	24	1340.99	1342.73	1.74		Maybe it goes there

3	24	7.986	8.547	0.561			Researcher Out
3	24	9.49	12.29	2.8	You have to mix all the pieces up, you can't just keep 'em in order.		
3	24	9.75	10.47	0.72		Why do-	
3	24	14.57	19.33	4.76	NAME

3	48	603.9	604.263	0.363			
3	48	614.567	618.049	3.482		### When I get my surprise?	
3	48	617.902	620.115	2.213	Well, you have to complete the study first		
3	48	623.786	626.83	3.044	*singing*		
3	48	627.641	629.222	1.581		Nope, don't go	
3	48	628.229	630.238	2.009	*singing*		
3	48	631.938	636.398	4.46	*singing*		
3	48	636.333	638.135	1.802		I need another red	
3	48	639.456	641.024	1.568		Where's some red?	
3	48	641.203	650.468	9.265	*singing/humming*		
3	48	651.414	653.866	2.452	Let's see... Let's put this piece in here		
3	48	654.556	655.529	0.973	No, it doesn't go		
3	48	656.892	658.724	1.832	Does this go? Yeah that goes 		
3	48	656.937	657.308	0.371		But	
3	48	659.84	661.849	2.009	Let's move it over to this side maybe		
3	48	664.043	665.141	1.098	Like that		
3	48	664.917	667.92	3.003			
3	48	665.556	666.14	0.584	Yeah		
3	48	666.556	667.167	0.611	mmkay		
3	48	668.505	670.024	1.519		What's on this ###	
3	48	669.052	671.592	2.54	And I think the butterfly goes down here in the corner		
3	48	672.796	674.1	1.304			
3	48	674.181	674.185	0.004		*singing*	
3	48	674.185	690.109	15.924		*singing*	
3	48	683.505	686.216	2.711			
3	48	688.352	690.91	2.558	No, I don't think that goes; here try this one		
3	48	692.242	696.431	4.189		*singing*	
3	48	692.654	694.654	2.0	Stick the, stick it in there		
3	48	696.38	699.327	2.947	No, that point, in there, try it in there		
3	48	700.779	702.3	1.521		*humming*	
3	48	701.274	703.938	2.664	No, that doesn't go. Let's try another one		
3	48	702.999	704.418	1.419			
3	48	704.286	707.402	3.116		*humming*	
3	48	707.884	709.292	1.408	Let's try this one		
3	48	710.576	711.559	0.983	Stick it in there		
3	48	711.887	712.869	0.982	There we go		
3	48	714.143	714.701	0.558	I think		
3	48	715.72	716.343	0.623		Think yeah	
3	48	716.444	717.825	1.381	Yeah, there we go		
3	48	716.81	718.651	1.841			
3	48	717.836	719.575	1.739		This go right here	
3	48	720.027	721.776	1.749			
3	48	721.248	722.479	1.231	Ooh, good job		
3	48	723.888	724.218	0.33			
3	48	727.798	729.594	1.796	The- I think these stay over this way		
3	48	729.893	730.397	0.504	Like		
3	48	731.946	733.132	1.186	I'm trying to think		
3	48	734.335	737.158	2.823	Does it go, no I think it's got some red, goes over there		
3	48	739.424	741.548	2.124	Like this one, try this one in there		
3	48	742.034	742.972	0.938	In here		
3	48	744.671	745.379	0.708	Yeah		
3	48	746.0	747.283	1.283	And then that goes		
3	48	747.38	748.973	1.593	right here		
3	48	747.869	749.436	1.567			
3	48	749.566	750.654	1.088	good job		
3	48	755.831	756.928	1.097	You think that goes there?		
3	48	757.486	760.229	2.743	I think we need to look for something with leopard spots		
3	48	760.618	761.229	0.611	Let's		
3	48	762.194	764.671	2.477	Let's try to find something with leopard spots		
3	48	768.096	768.954	0.858	No		
3	48	769.583	771.282	1.699	It has to have a flat side though		
3	48	775.645	777.698	2.053	This puzzle is more challenging		
3	48	776.952	778.272	1.32			
3	48	779.388	780.167	0.779	Good job		
3	48	783.954	784.937	0.983	Maybe it goes here?		
3	48	787.574	788.308	0.734	Maybe		
3	48	788.839	789.468	0.629	Maybe		
3	48	790.229	791.114	0.885	No		
3	48	791.536	792.362	0.826		No?	
3	48	792.956	794.985	2.029		But it have green right here	
3	48	794.575	797.061	2.486	Yeah, but it's a little different; let's try this one		
3	48	797.898	800.318	2.42		It's already sticked	
3	48	798.681	799.407	0.726	I got it		
3	48	799.84	800.304	0.464	mm-mm		
3	48	801.115	802.23	1.115		mm-hmm	
3	48	801.725	804.203	2.478	Let's try that one. No, turn it around		
3	48	805.636	806.486	0.85	Like this		
3	48	809.415	811.716	2.301	No, I don't think that, that doesn't go either		
3	48	812.654	813.743	1.089	Oh, wow		
3	48	814.23	815.477	1.247	How about this one?		
3	48	815.778	817.087	1.309	Did we try that one already?		
3	48	818.087	818.521	0.434	No		
3	48	819.666	821.869	2.203		I think we goes right	
3	48	821.034	822.804	1.77	Where's the ant's head?		
3	48	825.782	827.913	2.131		I don't have no ant head	
3	48	831.202	832.362	1.16		*sigh*	
3	48	833.893	836.017	2.124	Okay, this goes here		
3	48	835.39	836.535	1.145			
3	48	838.619	841.645	3.026	Let's try to finish the rest of the butterfly, then maybe we can		
3	48	840.39	841.723	1.333			
3	48	843.129	844.433	1.304			
3	48	846.557	847.946	1.389	No, this goes with the bird		
3	48	850.229	851.238	1.009	So that's the beak		
3	48	853.432	855.353	1.921	Now let's see where it goes with the bird		
3	48	855.698	857.388	1.69	It goes, I think maybe somewhere		
3	48	860.681	863.575	2.894	Mm-mm. That doesn't look right		
3	48	867.982	870.061	2.079	I know this goes down here		
3	48	868.912	870.246	1.334			
3	48	872.912	876.115	3.203		### Seconds	
3	48	872.937	875.459	2.522	How about this? Try this one here		
3	48	878.739	880.188	1.449			
3	48	880.22	881.158	0.938	Mmkay		
3	48	881.724	884.868	3.144		I want my four seconds	
3	48	884.406	885.76	1.354	I don't think that goes there		
3	48	888.694	891.027	2.333		Nope. Try the other one	
3	48	890.521	892.035	1.514	This goes here		
3	48	892.853	893.375	0.522		Yup	
3	48	893.636	894.679	1.043		Goes right here	
3	48	895.448	896.592	1.144			
3	48	895.459	895.973	0.514	Now		
3	48	897.81	904.694	6.884		Ooh I think this goes right here	
3	48	901.056	902.65	1.594			
3	48	905.274	906.404	1.13			
3	48	905.556	906.3	0.744	mm-mm		
3	48	906.273	907.012	0.739		No	
3	48	908.186	911.794	3.608		*whining*	
3	48	911.91	912.794	0.884		red	
3	48	914.36	917.78	3.42		*whining*	
3	48	918.099	918.736	0.637		No	
3	48	920.898	921.391	0.493		###	
3	48	930.865	932.255	1.39	Mm-mm don't bang it		
3	48	937.578	938.318	0.74		*whining*	
3	48	939.238	942.079	2.841	No, that doesn't fit; you can't force it to fit		
3	48	943.637	944.725	1.088	That doesn't go there		
3	48	945.999	947.415	1.416	Let's look for something with a leaf		
3	48	950.556	951.928	1.372	Are we missing a piece?		
3	48	953.91	955.804	1.894	Did a piece fall off ###		
3	48	956.934	957.693	0.759		Hmm	
3	48	957.795	958.282	0.487	No		
3	48	963.864	964.26	0.396			
3	48	968.724	969.97	1.246			
3	48	969.548	970.896	1.348		Where's this go?	
3	48	971.379	972.211	0.832	I don't know		
3	48	973.283	975.221	1.938	I think it goes over here. Maybe		
3	48	976.769	977.185	0.416	No		
3	48	978.318	979.875	1.557	Oh, up here. Try it up here		
3	48	979.301	981.214	1.913		It's move ###	
3	48	981.211	982.158	0.947	Nope, this way		
3	48	985.289	986.376	1.087			
3	48	985.946	986.928	0.982	There we go		
3	48	988.054	990.88	2.826		Okay

3	48	996.492	997.448	0.956			
3	48	1001.652	1002.376	0.724		*whining*	
3	48	1001.694	1002.781	1.087			
3	48	1002.804	1004.512	1.708	Don't get frustrated, it's okay		
3	48	1005.839	1008.423	2.584	Let's try, let's try this piece down there		
3	48	1008.636	1009.556	0.92	Try that piece		
3	48	1010.027	1011.013	0.986			
3	48	1010.99	1012.025	1.035	There ya go		
3	48	1012.868	1014.81	1.942		*whining*	
3	48	1013.521	1014.982	1.461	Now, the froggy-		
3	48	1017.601	1019.504	1.903	How about we try this piece right there		
3	48	1023.3	1025.406	2.106	Does it go? No it doesn't fit		
3	48	1026.535	1027.549	1.014		No	
3	48	1026.699	1028.097	1.398	Let's try another piece		
3	48	1029.238	1030.796	1.558	Aah, let's try this piece		
3	48	1032.035	1033.221	1.186	Try this piece right here		
3	48	1037.622	1038.492	0.87			
3	48	1038.423	1039.149	0.726	Aha!		
3	48	1039.621	1040.418	0.797		*laughing*	
3	48	1044.883	1047.343	2.46	And, think we're gonna finish this one in time		
3	48	1047.361	1048.463	1.102			
3	48	1051.072	1053.144	2.072		So I can get my surprise	
3	48	1057.274	1058.535	1.261			
3	48	1058.272	1059.246	0.974	Ah, there you go		
3	48	1061.288	1062.39	1.102

3	48	1070.715	1071.998	1.283	Yeah, try that one up there		
3	48	1072.663	1075.442	2.779	No, you had it the right way the first way though, press it in		
3	48	1075.505	1076.433	0.928			
3	48	1076.176	1076.69	0.514	Good

3	48	1083.716	1085.831	2.115	This goes over here somewhere		
3	48	1087.327	1089.955	2.628	Try it here, but I don't think it goes there		
3	48	1090.522	1094.026	3.504	Ooh, we have it wrong, we have to move this down		
3	48	1093.999	1095.057	1.058			
3	48	1095.787	1096.353	0.566	Now

3	48	1117.264	1119.477	2.213	Look for the colors; look for the same colors		
3	48	1121.485	1123.317	1.832	So like where do you think this one goes?		
3	48	1125.087	1125.715	0.628	good

4	48	19.62	20.19	0.57		Break	
4	48	20.72	24.95	4.23		I wanna do these parts. These parts is easy for me	
4	48	24.37	25.87	1.5	Well you gotta take it apart, first		
4	48	26.87	28.34	1.47	'Cause otherwise you already know what it looks like		
4	48	32.85	35.68	2.83	You're gonna do that part? I'm gonna put the edge pieces in		
4	48	36.65	39.27	2.62		Wait, wait, I'm gonna take these pieces	
4	48	38.16	39.23	1.07	Then it'll be easier		
4	48	39.84	41.66	1.82		And I'm gonna put them right there

4	48	543.18	544.51	1.33	Oh this looks like part of the snake		
4	48	544.87	545.62	0.75		Snake	
4	48	545.01	545.61	0.6	Up there		
4	48	547.06	550.8	3.74	Um, I think, look 'cause it's on the edge.  See where that's a flat edge?		
4	48	551.38	552.69	1.31	I think it goes up here somewhere		
4	48	555.56	556.26	0.7		Oh!	
4	48	556.4	556.88	0.48	*gasp*		
4	48	556.82	561.4	4.58		It fits right here, but it, it's not going because I have to move it	
4	48	561.3	564.44	3.14	You don't have to move it, you just have to pop it in there like a click		
4	48	565.62	566.55	0.93			
4	48	566.5	567.02	0.52	There		
4	48	567.11	567.54	0.43		*laughing*	
4	48	567.6	568.2	0.6	*laughing*		
4	48	568.01	568.8	0.79		Pop it	
4	48	568.7	569.84	1.14	Just pop it right in there		
4	48	570.5	570.84	0.34	Oh		
4	48	571.33	572.62	1.29	It looks like that might go next to it		
4	48	572.077	591.36	19.283		*noises*	
4	48	574.3	575.44	1.14	No, over by the snake		
4	48	582.03	583.07	1.04			
4	48	591.74	595.06	3.32		Oh, it's not fitting, ooh	
4	48	592.67	594.19	1.52			
4	48	594.66	595.58	0.92	Get it in		
4	48	596.14	596.9	0.76			
4	48	596.94	597.46	0.52	*gasp*		
4	48	597.03	597.57	0.54		###	
4	48	598.03	598.49	0.46		Oh	
4	48	599.7	603.35	3.65		This puzzle right here, this puzzle round	
4	48	607.19	609.95	2.76		This, how I turn this ###	
4	48	609.76	611.28	1.52	I think maybe it goes by the snake		
4	48	612.47	614.68	2.21		I go by the snake	
4	48	614.46	614.89	0.43	*gasp*		
4	48	614.59	615.51	0.92			
4	48	615.15	616.15	1.0	You did it!		
4	48	617.33	619.49	2.16		It goes like that, monkeys go like that	
4	48	618.057	619.113	1.056			
4	48	619.37	620.12	0.75	Woo hoo!		
4	48	620.37	621.17	0.8		I did it	
4	48	621.98	622.78	0.8	mmhmm		
4	48	622.51	623.35	0.84		I helped you	
4	48	623.31	624.68	1.37	You helped me, you're right		
4	48	626.84	629.12	2.28		And this piece might go somewhere else	
4	48	629.41	633.16	3.75	You know what, lookit. See how it has flat edge, it means it goes up here somewhere		
4	48	633.27	634.22	0.95		Oh yeah	
4	48	634.51	635.68	1.17		You're right, Mom!	
4	48	635.85	636.55	0.7	*gasps*		
4	48	637.38	640.05	2.67	Oh you almost had it. You gotta put the flat edge in the top		
4	48	642.0	642.84	0.84	Turn it around		
4	48	643.15	643.96	0.81	Yeah, there you go		
4	48	644.27	645.87	1.6	Tur- No, look, look		
4	48	646.2	646.69	0.49	See?		
4	48	647.07	648.73	1.66	The flat edge goes by the flat edge		
4	48	649.46	650.98	1.52	And then I think those fit together		
4	48	651.25	652.02	0.77			
4	48	651.67	652.19	0.52	*gasp*		
4	48	654.01	654.78	0.77	Woohoo		
4	48	655.33	656.73	1.4		And where does this piece go?	
4	48	657.23	657.74	0.51	mmm		
4	48	658.98	663.15	4.17	That does not have a flat edge, so it doesn't go up there. But this one goes right here		
4	48	662.67	663.37	0.7			
4	48	663.61	665.85	2.24	And then I think this is the last edge piece		
4	48	667.491	668.382	0.891			
4	48	667.83	669.51	1.68	Can you get it in there? Woo!		
4	48	669.01	669.41	0.4		Uh	
4	48	670.51	673.63	3.12		And where does this flat edge go?	
4	48	674.4	676.01	1.61	Only a couple more pieces		
4	48	676.93	677.46	0.53	Look		
4	48	677.16	679.48	2.32		It goes to this!	
4	48	679.47	680.757	1.287			
4	48	679.49	679.92	0.43	*gasp*		
4	48	680.31	681.25	0.94	I got that one		
4	48	681.53	682.47	0.94	Parrot		
4	48	683.48	685.33	1.85	Uhh, Try it- Scoot it over that way		
4	48	688.05	689.03	0.98	Oh, you know what?		
4	48	689.7	691.06	1.36	Oh, maybe it goes down here somewhere		
4	48	693.71	698.25	4.54	Like maybe this one. Oh look, yeah, them leaves match up right there		
4	48	700.26	701.679	1.419			
4	48	700.34	701.87	1.53	Those are kinda hard to push in there, right?		
4	48	703.692	705.111	1.419			
4	48	707.24	711.22	3.98		There's a piece missing right here	
4	48	710.54	711.83	1.29	Mm-hmm, What do we think that one is?		
4	48	712.83	713.42	0.59	Try this one?		
4	48	714.93	715.76	0.83	Hurry		
4	48	716.18	717.53	1.35	Almost done, almost done!		
4	48	719.63	720.58	0.95			
4	48	721.39	724.37	2.98	Yep. Oh look, I think that one slides right into there		
4	48	725.17	726.43	1.26	Wait, it was right		
4	48	726.62	727.73	1.11	Put it right, right there		
4	48	728.38	730.12	1.74	Pop it in. See where it matches up?		
4	48	729.68	731.57	1.89			
4	48	732.07	733.92	1.85	Look, one more piece!		
4	48	736.96	737.53	0.57		###	
4	48	739.4	741.3	1.9	Mmm, Might have to turn it around		
4	48	743.74	744.7	0.96			
4	48	744.249	744.711	0.462			48 Piece - End
4	24	791.835	792.132	0.297			24 Piece - Start
4	24	792.33	793.64	1.31		Ooh	
4	24	793.79	794.51	0.72	Alright		
4	24	796.83	797.64	0.81		Yeah	
4	24	798.52	800.24	1.72		Now break it apart!	
4	24	798.765	799.095	0.33			Researcher Out
4	24	800.17	801.2	1.03	### it apart		
4	24	804.64	805.51	0.87		Rah!	
4	24	806.19	808.15	1.96		Stupid butts!	
4	24	808.46	809.02	0.56	No		
4	24	809.55	810.36	0.81	Don't say that		
4	24	811.7	813.69	1.99		I'm building an ###	
4	24	814.45	816.53	2.08		See these ones will go down there	
4	24	817.02	819.53	2.51		###	
4	24	821.01	822.97	1.96	Oh, was that already put together?		
4	24	823.45	824.32	0.87		Yeah	
4	24	824.45	825.55	1.1	You're a cheater		
4	24	825.52	828.5	2.98		I I I ###	
4	24	829.04	829.46	0.42	Wha-		
4	24	829.06	832.75	3.69		I I I, Can you push me in?	
4	24	832.69	833.25	0.56	Mm-hmm		
4	24	833.05	837.36	4.31		Slide me in *noises*	
4	24	838.1	841.35	3.25		How do we know this puzzle is a shark	
4	24	842.22	844.85	2.63		This puzzle's kind of noisy	
4	24	845.68	846.2	0.52	Yeah		
4	24	848.59	851.06	2.47		How about this one goes, like, here	
4	24	850.55	850.98	0.43	*gasp*		
4	24	851.928	852.093	0.165			
4	24	851.93	852.64	0.71		Got it	
4	24	852.48	855.87	3.39	Do you think maybe we should turn it around though? 'Cause it looks like he's upside down		
4	24	858.45	862.47	4.02	Well no, not the whole thing, just the- Here, like maybe it goes this way		
4	24	863.41	864.24	0.83	I think		
4	24	865.29	866.98	1.69	Here's another piece of the octopus		
4	24	868.57	871.14	2.57	And, is that another piece? *gasp*		
4	24	869.37	871.8	2.43		A sucker. It's a sucky	
4	24	872.72	874.53	1.81		It's called a sucker winner	
4	24	874.24	875.97	1.73	Should we watch Elf when we get home?		
4	24	876.23	876.6	0.37		No	
4	24	876.93	877.48	0.55	No?		
4	24	878.23	878.66	0.43		Why	
4	24	879.3	880.62	1.32		Why should we watch Elf?	
4	24	880.81	884.26	3.45	I don't know, because it's so funny and you keep talking about it, it makes me want to watch it		
4	24	885.84	888.37	2.53		*noises*	
4	24	885.9	887.37	1.47			
4	24	887.7	888.6	0.9	Did you figure that one out?		
4	24	888.9	890.0	1.1	I think- *gasp*		
4	24	890.769	891.957	1.188			
4	24	892.13	893.14	1.01	Good job		
4	24	893.6	896.67	3.07	Here's another part of it. I think these two both go with it, too		
4	24	900.86	902.01	1.15		It's a big butt	
4	24	901.03	902.82	1.79	What does he say when he goes in the-		
4	24	903.27	905.46	2.19	"In the mailroom, right? He says ""It's a sucky thing"""		
4	24	906.28	908.08	1.8	When the mail thing sucks up the mail		
4	24	910.13	911.46	1.33	Is that what you were trying to talk about?		
4	24	911.94	912.42	0.48		Yeah	
4	24	913.35	916.56	3.21		He sucks up, sucks up the ###	
4	24	916.24	917.73	1.49	It's so sucky, right?		
4	24	918.59	919.71	1.12		So sucky	
4	24	920.44	921.89	1.45		This thing is so sucky	
4	24	922.72	923.23	0.51		Sucky	
4	24	922.8	924.16	1.36	Here, I think that goes underneath it		
4	24	924.49	925.92	1.43		*noises*	
4	24	925.96	927.77	1.81	Look, I have a crab almost done		
4	24	929.31	929.98	0.67		Crab	
4	24	932.49	935.22	2.73	Oh yeah I think if you turn it around you might fit that one in there		
4	24	936.25	936.63	0.38		Yeah	
4	24	936.7	937.13	0.43	*gasp*		
4	24	938.16	941.12	2.96	Ooh, you're so smart		
4	24	940.86	942.77	1.91		What ###	
4	24	942.15	945.36	3.21	I think it might've- I think it might go right next to this		
4	24	943.338	944.262	0.924			
4	24	946.13	946.78	0.65		Yeah	
4	24	946.18	946.97	0.79	You think?		
4	24	949.12	950.76	1.64	Oh, slide it in there		
4	24	949.65	952.74	3.09			
4	24	953.96	954.91	0.95	Whoa		
4	24	955.86	959.81	3.95		*noises*	
4	24	956.2	957.68	1.48	That is so cool		
4	24	960.59	962.58	1.99		Look at what we did	
4	24	962.28	965.7	3.42	Look, I think this is the jellyfish or something		
4	24	962.48	963.59	1.11			
4	24	965.28	968.1	2.82		Jellyfish. Ooh and	
4	24	967.45	968.49	1.04	Oh, look		
4	24	968.98	971.64	2.66	You have to get the mouth of the shark right next to where you just had it		
4	24	971.916	972.081	0.165			
4	24	973.12	973.98	0.86	Right there, yep		
4	24	976.55	977.79	1.24			
4	24	977.39	978.21	0.82	Hmm		
4	24	979.27	979.84	0.57		Jelly	
4	24	982.74	983.72	0.98		Jellyfish	
4	24	985.01	985.48	0.47	*gasp*		
4	24	985.776	986.832	1.056	###		
4	24	987.33	988.49	1.16		*noises*	
4	24	990.02	991.84	1.82	And this goes somewhere in there, too		
4	24	991.22	992.81	1.59		This is a big man	
4	24	993.28	994.54	1.26	I forget what that's called		
4	24	998.15	999.53	1.38		Think that goes right there	
4	24	999.52	1000.03	0.51	*gasp*		
4	24	1000.65	1001.65	1.0	Woo hoo!		
4	24	1002.49	1004.08	1.59		And where does this piece go?	
4	24	1005.09	1008.55	3.46	I dunno, mmm, maybe, maybe down here somewhere		
4	24	1009.51	1011.51	2.0	And I think this one goes right up-		
4	24	1012.27	1012.86	0.59	Uh		
4	24	1013.39	1014.05	0.66		No!	
4	24	1013.6	1014.87	1.27	Oh, maybe it goes right there!		
4	24	1014.57	1015.76	1.19			
4	24	1015.04	1018.11	3.07		No, it's gonna make two sharks if we went right here	
4	24	1018.51	1020.9	2.39	*gasp* Look, I think this all slides back together		
4	24	1021.66	1022.7	1.04	Slide it on over		
4	24	1022.571	1024.155	1.584			
4	24	1024.155	1025.541	1.386			
4	24	1025.5	1026.01	0.51	*gasp*		
4	24	1026.36	1027.08	0.72	Oh my gosh		
4	24	1027.2	1028.45	1.25	We are so smart		
4	24	1028.86	1030.1	1.24		Yes, we are	
4	24	1032.41	1033.61	1.2			
4	24	1033.45	1035.06	1.61		This goes right here	
4	24	1034.52	1035.51	0.99	Good job		
4	24	1036.78	1037.93	1.15	I think		
4	24	1038.66	1040.19	1.53	This might be that corner over there		
4	24	1042.94	1044.35	1.41			
4	24	1044.17	1045.66	1.49		That's where I want it to fit in	
4	24	1045.59	1046.93	1.34	Mmkay where do you think that one goes?		
4	24	1047.76	1050.0	2.24		*noises*	
4	24	1050.82	1053.53	2.71		This, I don't know how this goes	
4	24	1055.01	1057.32	2.31	Oh I think you had it right, look at where the edge is		
4	24	1060.02	1061.06	1.04	Look at where the edge is		
4	24	1062.26	1065.19	2.93	See where the straight parts are, and where the straight part of the puzzle is?		
4	24	1068.38	1070.22	1.84	That thing is going on again, what is that?		
4	24	1075.92	1078.77	2.85	*laughing* What is it-It's part of that over there		
4	24	1079.95	1081.57	1.62	I think it's part of the heat or something		
4	24	1083.09	1085.06	1.97	Air's coming out of that, that's why it's making that noise		
4	24	1083.19	1084.16	0.97		It's going like	
4	24	1084.82	1090.1	5.28		*noises*	
4	24	1088.05	1088.61	0.56	*laughing*		
4	24	1089.43	1093.41	3.98	Mmm, I don't think that's right. 'Cause this doesn't fit. You're gonna break the puzzle

16	48	88.11	88.638	0.528		The	
16	48	91.674	99.99	8.316		Pick a animal and start the animal. Let's do the #### the this one, this kind of animal first	
16	48	92.07	93.258	1.188	Start from the inside		
16	48	92.895	93.126	0.231			
16	48	94.248	94.974	0.726	Okay		
16	48	100.056	101.376	1.32	What does that look like it is?		
16	48	102.96	110.979	8.019		Well let's see. It has a- two green eyes	
16	48	110.979	113.553	2.574	And it has a nose *sniffing*		
16	48	114.741	115.764	1.023	Do you remember where he went?		
16	48	117.513	118.833	1.32		Across the hall	
16	48	119.031	132.132	13.101	*laughing* No I mean the m- The puzzle. Do you remember where this animal went in the puzzle? Was he in a corner, was he on a side, was he at the top?		
16	48	130.746	133.056	2.31		Right, he was right over here	
16	48	132.792	134.277	1.485	Okay so let's put him in place		
16	48	134.277	137.412	3.135		And he's, he's  only a head	
16	48	136.422	142.461	6.039	So he has spots, right? I see some more pieces with spots. Does that look like part of a nose?		
16	48	142.164	149.028	6.864		Yeah, a part of his, His nose. Don't take it it's his nose. ###	
16	48	146.19	147.015	0.825	Yeah		
16	48	148.401	150.909	2.508	Gather up the pieces with spots		
16	48	153.681	156.948	3.267		I got these, these ones	
16	48	158.433	158.961	0.528		Mmm	
16	48	163.02	164.967	1.947		These are, um	
16	48	165.66	167.673	2.013	Okay, have we gotten all the ones with spots?		
16	48	167.706	168.399	0.693		No	
16	48	169.521	170.874	1.353	Now do we have them all?		
16	48	171.963	172.854	0.891		Yes	
16	48	172.689	173.118	0.429	Okay		
16	48	173.448	174.042	0.594		###	
16	48	177.969	178.794	0.825	Okay		
16	48	182.919	184.635	1.716	Hmm		
16	48	185.79	187.011	1.221		No it does go-	
16	48	186.384	190.212	3.828	Probably his eyes go above his nose somehow, don't you think?		
16	48	191.004	191.532	0.528		Yes	
16	48	191.73	192.918	1.188	Yeah, probably		
16	48	202.422	203.511	1.089	Mm-hmm		
16	48	204.831	207.471	2.64	Hmm		
16	48	207.537	210.771	3.234		It's a big animal, he's really big, he's-	
16	48	210.21	210.936	0.726	*laughing*		
16	48	211.662	218.658	6.996		It's r- It doesn't attach. This- The snake goes higher up	
16	48	212.883	213.147	0.264			
16	48	214.797	216.414	1.617	Oh, I was wrong		
16	48	227.139	229.449	2.31	Hmm, I think it would need one of those...		
16	48	231.693	232.881	1.188	poker-outer pieces		
16	48	246.279	247.962	1.683	A-ha!		
16	48	251.988	255.882	3.894	Does that look like it's the jaguar's ear?		
16	48	258.258	259.842	1.584		It does look like	
16	48	260.37	262.185	1.815	I think that might be his ear		
16	48	262.878	264.363	1.485	And that might be the other one		
16	48	269.049	270.336	1.287		I don't know	
16	48	272.316	275.352	3.036	Hmm, maybe it goes a different way		
16	48	272.349	274.197	1.848		*noises*	
16	48	275.22	277.068	1.848		It's so hard!	
16	48	277.068	278.289	1.221	Maybe it goes this way		
16	48	280.533	281.325	0.792	No		
16	48	283.239	286.44	3.201	Maybe it goes like this, there's a little white there, maybe it goes like that?		
16	48	288.024	289.113	1.089		No	
16	48	288.783	289.476	0.693	No		
16	48	291.39	292.974	1.584	Does the ear go like this?		
16	48	294.921	299.112	4.191	Hmm, no. I think we have to match up the spots		
16	48	300.399	301.95	1.551	Can you help me match up the spots?		
16	48	303.138	304.095	0.957		Mm-hmm	
16	48	304.425	307.329	2.904	See, if he has an ear here and an ear there...		
16	48	314.127	320.232	6.105	Mm-hmm! Now we're just missing his other ear. Oop! I see a little piece with spots on it		
16	48	322.872	324.39	1.518		With spots on it	
16	48	325.248	327.129	1.881		Now what- Ooh!	
16	48	326.205	329.571	3.366	Hmm, and then what's gonna go down here?		
16	48	331.221	335.775	4.554	So let's keep that one over here since this one also has spots on it and maybe we'll figure out-		
16	48	331.353	332.079	0.726		Uh	
16	48	332.904	333.135	0.231			
16	48	337.392	338.745	1.353	A butterfly		
16	48	339.834	342.441	2.607		I can't do this butterfly, this butterfly is-	
16	48	347.721	350.889	3.168	I think we're gonna run out of room, maybe if we move him over a little bit		
16	48	351.12	361.284	10.164	We've got a bunch of butterfly pieces here. Ooh! This one's a straight edge, so that- It e- It either goes here, or here, don't you think? Do you think it goes down here, or over here?		
16	48	361.878	367.653	5.775		I think this might go over here, this has spots	
16	48	367.752	368.478	0.726	Mm-hmm		
16	48	369.732	370.491	0.759		###	
16	48	370.161	373.56	3.399	Does it fit there? Well this has a blade of green grass coming down		
16	48	379.203	380.754	1.551	There we go		
16	48	386.694	390.819	4.125		Looks a little bit like a monarch butter- butterfly	
16	48	390.06	396.462	6.402	Hmm, like a monarch butterfly? I thought monarchs were orange and black		
16	48	397.32	399.069	1.749		Yes they are but these-	
16	48	398.64	403.953	5.313	But we've seen butterflies that are- have that blue color at the butterfly museum, haven't we?		
16	48	404.448	405.966	1.518		Yeah, I have	
16	48	408.54	410.454	1.914	I see little spots in there		
16	48	412.335	413.49	1.155		Let's go right here	
16	48	413.457	416.097	2.64	Mm-hmm, we've almost got the butterfly all put together		
16	48	416.757	420.189	3.432	So #### got another piece here, and another piece here		
16	48	423.258	426.888	3.63	Ooh, and this piece. That looks like a corner		
16	48	430.584	431.244	0.66		Aah!	
16	48	431.409	431.937	0.528	Hmm?		
16	48	431.871	435.963	4.092		This goes- This goes more down over here	
16	48	434.94	436.557	1.617	You sure that this one fits here?		
16	48	437.019	440.88	3.861	It doesn't seem to fit very well. I think this one must not go here		
16	48	443.454	447.216	3.762		Yes it does, see?	
16	48	446.193	448.602	2.409	But look at the little lines, they don't match up		
16	48	450.054	455.796	5.742	I don't know. We've got one other piece, why don't you try one- the other piece and see if it fits better than that one does		
16	48	459.657	462.924	3.267	That's a corner, we can zip it down		
16	48	461.901	464.112	2.211			
16	48	467.61	468.897	1.287			
16	48	469.788	470.547	0.759	There!		
16	48	473.022	473.781	0.759		*laughing*	
16	48	473.649	476.388	2.739	This one still has the spots where do you think that one goes?		
16	48	479.787	480.117	0.33		Oh	
16	48	479.787	482.889	3.102	Ooh, I think this is an ear here		
16	48	483.945	485.298	1.353			
16	48	485.067	485.793	0.726	Yeah		
16	48	487.74	491.601	3.861		Was he a ear here	
16	48	490.413	491.205	0.792	Oh!		
16	48	492.162	494.439	2.277	Now he has his two ears and he can hear us		
16	48	495.429	498.465	3.036	Hello, Mr. Jaguar, how are you?		
16	48	505.527	507.276	1.749		Ow I ####	
16	48	506.286	506.979	0.693	Hmm		
16	48	507.771	508.86	1.089			
16	48	508.926	509.322	0.396	There		
16	48	511.533	517.638	6.105	Alright, what's next? Should we do the snake? Or there's some sort of a plant over here?		
16	48	514.965	515.889	0.924		*noises*	
16	48	519.651	522.357	2.706		There's, a frog is on	
16	48	523.05	523.677	0.627	Huh		
16	48	525.525	527.34	1.815		Those go over there	
16	48	527.34	529.452	2.112	Well here's another part of that plant		
16	48	530.541	533.115	2.574	And here's another part, now this has an edge		
16	48	534.039	536.91	2.871		Here's some more of, some more	
16	48	538.989	539.814	0.825		####	
16	48	539.418	547.767	8.349	Ooh I see some froggy toes like that over here with this piece. Maybe these are not too far away from each other. They also have similar stripes		
16	48	551.166	551.727	0.561	Mmm		
16	48	553.278	557.403	4.125	Since they- They aren't attached to anything yet they might be difficult to figure out		
16	48	559.779	564.102	4.323	But we know that those are froggy feet, right? So here's the frog		
16	48	566.874	569.844	2.97		This is the big frog and this is the little frog	
16	48	570.207	571.263	1.056	Mm-hmm		
16	48	572.154	574.629	2.475		Mommy, I see a little f-	
16	48	572.847	573.111	0.264			
16	48	573.045	576.246	3.201	### Oh there's more frog feet, how many frogs were there?		
16	48	577.005	577.698	0.693		Two	
16	48	580.272	585.882	5.61	Maybe those are the toes that are missing, Mm-hmm		
16	48	587.169	588.984	1.815	We've reattached its toes		
16	48	590.766	593.208	2.442		His toes ####	
16	48	596.904	600.831	3.927		####	
16	48	598.62	601.689	3.069	There you go! Do a little surgery and get his toes back on		
16	48	602.679	604.395	1.716	There! Great		
16	48	606.045	607.464	1.419	Hmm		
16	48	610.566	613.734	3.168	Okay, so we've got froggy feet, we have a frog head-		
16	48	618.915	621.192	2.277	No, that doesn't go there		
16	48	623.04	626.208	3.168	Maybe these are in the way, put these over here, yeah?		
16	48	626.703	628.815	2.112		I think this goes right here	
16	48	627.825	628.782	0.957			
16	48	629.409	630.267	0.858	Good eyes		
16	48	631.851	632.907	1.056		#### This-	
16	48	632.511	635.019	2.508	This looks like this attaches right there		
16	48	632.808	634.821	2.013			
16	48	638.451	639.441	0.99		It does	
16	48	639.21	640.2	0.99	Mm-hmm		
16	48	643.038	644.028	0.99	What's next?		
16	48	644.457	647.757	3.3		Here's this one is the one who's on it	
16	48	647.493	649.77	2.277	Oh, well he's a corner, you see?		
16	48	650.166	651.255	1.089		He goes up here	
16	48	651.189	652.608	1.419			
16	48	651.354	652.08	0.726	Okay		
16	48	653.334	654.687	1.353	Looks good to me		
16	48	660.198	662.607	2.409		*noises*	
16	48	662.211	662.97	0.759	Almost		
16	48	662.442	663.861	1.419			
16	48	663.564	663.96	0.396	There!		
16	48	663.96	664.686	0.726		There	
16	48	667.062	668.547	1.485	And...		
16	48	670.362	673.431	3.069		And, ta-da!	
16	48	670.857	672.474	1.617			
16	48	671.055	671.748	0.693	*laughing*		
16	48	673.266	674.19	0.924	Da-dum		
16	48	675.411	676.698	1.287		And	
16	48	676.038	677.952	1.914	Yeah, I bet that one goes up at the top		
16	48	679.569	681.714	2.145		ta-dum!	
16	48	679.668	681.351	1.683			
16	48	681.351	685.806	4.455	*laughing* Great! Now we have this snake		
16	48	686.565	688.38	1.815		Let's, here's-	
16	48	688.017	690.558	2.541	Is that part of his- Ooh I'm sorry, Is that part of his body?		
16	48	690.855	693.594	2.739		Yeah it is this ####	
16	48	691.944	693.627	1.683	And then this would be another part		
16	48	694.716	696.201	1.485			
16	48	696.432	698.148	1.716			
16	48	697.686	699.303	1.617		*noises*	
16	48	699.138	702.471	3.333	Ooh he's missing his eye, his other eye		
16	48	703.494	704.913	1.419	Can you see it anywhere?		
16	48	705.771	710.292	4.521	I think this is probably the sloth's hand, so that goes with the s- Oh and here's the other-		
16	48	711.843	713.559	1.716	I'd say those go together		
16	48	715.935	717.42	1.485	Where's the snake's eye?		
16	48	724.713	725.373	0.66	Hmm!		
16	48	728.937	730.257	1.32	Oh well, we'll find it		
16	48	731.049	734.712	3.663		Did it have an eye with ####	
16	48	735.57	736.89	1.32	Well now I don't remember		
16	48	737.946	742.368	4.422	Perhaps something else is covering it up. We'll find out when we get to that piece		
16	48	746.295	749.463	3.168	Here's another corner. I bet this one goes down here		
16	48	750.156	750.915	0.759		Mommy	
16	48	751.212	754.677	3.465	So then we just have one more corner to find		
16	48	756.558	759.759	3.201		This, this has to be right here	
16	48	759.066	767.877	8.811			
16	48	761.046	762.927	1.881	### if we pick them up		
16	48	767.646	768.702	1.056	Mm-hmm		
16	48	767.943	768.438	0.495		There	
16	48	770.22	771.573	1.353			
16	48	770.748	774.741	3.993	Well, what's next, how about these leaves, if we could fill in these, 'cause those-		
16	48	777.777	779.658	1.881	Are a pretty distinct pattern

20	48	70.125	72.666	2.541	Wait, let's- Remember we have to do it like we do at home?		
20	48	73.755	77.22	3.465	So, first we have to find all the edge pieces, right?		
20	48	77.616	78.111	0.495		Mmm	
20	48	78.738	80.454	1.716	Like, the pieces with a straight side?		
20	48	81.939	82.929	0.99	Yeah, there's one		
20	48	85.239	89.067	3.828	Okay, let's put those on the board first, and we'll just sort of		
20	48	90.222	93.522	3.3	We'll move the other ones out of our way for now, so we can get the frame-		
20	48	96.129	96.756	0.627		There	
20	48	96.855	97.845	0.99	Ooh yeah		
20	48	98.802	100.716	1.914	Okay, I see one corner		
20	48	101.772	105.567	3.795	Another corner, let's look underneath and see which corner the butterfly is supposed to be in		
20	48	107.382	108.471	1.089	This corner, right?		
20	48	108.768	109.461	0.693		Uh-huh	
20	48	109.758	110.187	0.429	So		
20	48	110.88	111.705	0.825		###	
20	48	111.441	113.091	1.65	This goes over here then, right?		
20	48	113.025	115.401	2.376		Mm-hmm, and this goes over...	
20	48	115.599	120.714	5.115	And I'll keep looking for edge pieces. You can start putting them together if you see some that-		
20	48	118.074	119.13	1.056		Here	
20	48	120.747	121.605	0.858		Here	
20	48	122.166	123.453	1.287	NAME		
20	48	124.146	125.532	1.386	If you see some that go together		
20	48	126.489	127.611	1.122	Go ahead and-		
20	48	128.931	131.901	2.97	Fit 'em together. Any more edges? Sorry		
20	48	135.366	137.115	1.749		Is that where it goes?	
20	48	137.214	140.547	3.333	Mmm, does that really fit? Does that- Not quite		
20	48	138.93	139.689	0.759		No	
20	48	142.296	143.682	1.386	Any more edge pieces?		
20	48	144.144	147.708	3.564	*gasp* This- Where do you think- Which corner do you think this belongs in?		
20	48	148.5	150.117	1.617		Let's check on the board	
20	48	150.117	156.288	6.171	Mmm, well let's take a guess. If the frog is sitting up, would it fit down here? Like this?		
20	48	156.684	158.961	2.277		It's sitting on the rose!	
20	48	159.885	160.446	0.561		###	
20	48	159.918	161.898	1.98	Well, if it's sitting it should be this way, right?		
20	48	162.096	162.591	0.495		Right	
20	48	162.426	163.119	0.693	Which corner?		
20	48	164.637	167.706	3.069	That one? But, look, I'm covering it up but		
20	48	168.96	170.577	1.617	This has two straight sides		
20	48	171.6	175.032	3.432	So it has to fit into one of these corners, this corner's full		
20	48	176.649	177.507	0.858	Does that look right?		
20	48	177.606	178.497	0.891		No	
20	48	178.332	179.157	0.825	What about over here?		
20	48	178.893	180.081	1.188			
20	48	179.883	180.741	0.858		Yes	
20	48	179.916	180.081	0.165

20	48	183.381	184.404	1.023	Any more edges?		
20	48	186.45	187.242	0.792	Here's one		
20	48	186.549	187.176	0.627		Mmm	
20	48	188.661	189.354	0.693	See any more?		
20	48	189.618	190.74	1.122		Here's one	
20	48	190.542	195.393	4.851	Here's one, with a little piece of butterfly on it, and some mushrooms, is that a hint?		
20	48	192.852	193.545	0.693		Here	
20	48	196.68	197.406	0.726	Mushrooms		
20	48	198.495	200.343	1.848	Grow up from the ground #		
20	48	199.881	203.379	3.498		Where's the mushroom, the other mushroom piece?	
20	48	204.435	205.26	0.825	There's one		
20	48	210.243	211.695	1.452	Found another corner		
20	48	212.685	214.104	1.419	It could go up here		
20	48	212.916	213.642	0.726		###	
20	48	215.82	217.503	1.683	Or it could go down here		
20	48	216.282	219.615	3.333		I haved fun having puzzles	
20	48	219.78	220.572	0.792	Which-		
20	48	221.463	224.73	3.267	What kinds of puzzles did you do? Here, let's put these together		
20	48	224.268	230.241	5.973		I did the dinosaur, I did farm, and I did animals	
20	48	232.98	233.706	0.726	Wanna help?		
20	48	235.026	236.973	1.947	I don't think that goes there, but-		
20	48	235.29	235.818	0.528		Um	
20	48	236.478	237.93	1.452		What does ###-

20	48	240.108	241.131	1.023			
20	48	241.131	244.86	3.729	Great. Hey you can- you can get started on the butterfly pieces if you want		
20	48	244.563	246.84	2.277		What does- Where does this go?	
20	48	247.038	248.721	1.683	Hmm, I don't know		
20	48	249.117	250.47	1.353		Maybe it goes here	
20	48	250.701	251.46	0.759	Maybe		
20	48	252.549	253.968	1.419		You think that looks right?	
20	48	254.991	258.654	3.663	I can't see, Does that look right? Hmm Oops, we lost a piece		
20	48	257.004	258.291	1.287		No	
20	48	259.512	260.634	1.122	Not quite		
20	48	261.756	264.462	2.706	What about if we do, It's gotta go on-		
20	48	261.987	262.416	0.429		###	
20	48	264.957	269.181	4.224	This straight edge has to go on one of these straight sides, right?		
20	48	270.567	272.679	2.112	Does that look quite right? No		
20	48	271.821	273.471	1.65		No	
20	48	273.339	275.715	2.376	Not quite, what about down here?		
20	48	275.913	277.53	1.617		No	
20	48	278.454	279.708	1.254		No	
20	48	279.774	280.401	0.627	No?		
20	48	280.83	281.985	1.155		Y- Yes!	
20	48	282.282	284.328	2.046	That little piece is broken		
20	48	283.305	285.648	2.343		It looks- It look- Yeah	
20	48	285.78	289.014	3.234	Yeah, so why don't you finish up on the butterfly		
20	48	290.928	292.512	1.584	And I'll keep		
20	48	294.921	296.01	1.089	Working over here		
20	48	298.386	300.234	1.848		Do you think that looks right?	
20	48	299.904	300.102	0.198			
20	48	300.135	301.785	1.65	I think that looks just right		
20	48	303.237	304.59	1.353	You got some more um-		
20	48	306.306	307.461	1.155	Where does this go?		
20	48	306.405	308.286	1.881		Butterfly pieces	
20	48	307.758	308.319	0.561	Does that-		
20	48	309.078	310.959	1.881		Yes! It looks right	
20	48	311.454	316.734	5.28	Does it? It does look right, but, the mushrooms- Let's take a look at our- at our picture		
20	48	312.048	313.401	1.353		No	
20	48	320.397	322.41	2.013	The mushrooms have to be on the bottom		
20	48	323.565	324.786	1.221		Probably yeah	
20	48	324.258	324.951	0.693	So		
20	48	326.238	327.228	0.99	Maybe		
20	48	330.363	332.739	2.376	Unless we're looking at that picture sideways		
20	48	336.435	337.392	0.957	Butterfly		
20	48	343.068	345.312	2.244	NAME		
20	48	344.157	344.817	0.66		###	
20	48	346.269	346.632	0.363		What?	
20	48	346.797	348.315	1.518	This actually goes over here		
20	48	348.513	349.8	1.287		What silly mom	
20	48	349.701	351.681	1.98			
20	48	349.734	352.704	2.97	I was looking at it sideways and my brain didn't flip it over		
20	48	354.288	355.344	1.056		What brain?	
20	48	355.74	356.895	1.155			
20	48	357.654	359.073	1.419	My brain inside my head		
20	48	359.436	360.558	1.122			
20	48	359.634	360.888	1.254	That looks better		
20	48	361.152	361.812	0.66		Yeah	
20	48	361.68	362.967	1.287	That makes more sense		
20	48	364.221	368.148	3.927		I think this one goes right... here	
20	48	366.828	368.115	1.287			
20	48	370.722	374.517	3.795	I think I see some butterfly in that- on that kitty's nose		
20	48	375.54	376.431	0.891	So maybe		
20	48	376.233	377.388	1.155			
20	48	379.038	381.744	2.706	Maybe that goes, you know, closer to the butterfly

20	24	980.628	984.192	3.564	And the sky above? So this must go somewhere towards the top, right?		
20	24	984.192	985.347	1.155		Yeah, there!	
20	24	985.743	989.703	3.96	But, it's a corner so... slide it over

20	24	998.382	999.009	0.627	###		
20	24	999.438	1000.56	1.122	It is a jellyfish		
20	24	1001.055	1005.312	4.257	Do you see any more... edge pieces or corners?		
20	24	1006.731	1007.226	0.495	Yes		
20	24	1008.513	1010.46	1.947	Hmm, that looks like a big smiling mouth

20	24	1021.944	1023.759	1.815		It's part of the shark	
20	24	1024.089	1033.263	9.174	Where does it go? I think I see that line again, the- the line where the water and the sky meet, but, it's a corner piece, right? So it goes in the-		
20	24	1035.573	1036.365	0.792		Uh	
20	24	1036.827	1041.447	4.62	Corner pieces # go in the... corners, right?

20	24	1047.387	1048.905	1.518	See any more edge pieces?		
20	24	1051.281	1052.304	1.023	I see some		
20	24	1052.832	1054.581	1.749		I see one	
20	24	1054.581	1056.726	2.145	Yeah, that's a corner too		
20	24	1057.749	1061.346	3.597	Nice, so you have all four corners. Now we need some more edges		
20	24	1058.079	1059.168	1.089			
20	24	1063.821	1066.428	2.607	What's up here? That light blue sky, right?		
20	24	1065.273	1066.989	1.716		Mom mom mom!

20	24	1071.609	1074.612	3.003	Now it looks like you have one, two more top edge pieces		
20	24	1075.437	1078.572	3.135	They probably also have that like, light blue sky on them		
20	24	1077.714	1078.176	0.462		Mom!

20	24	1086.426	1089.594	3.168	Let's keep looking for those edge pieces, then we can put 'em together		
20	24	1091.046	1092.135	1.089	NAME		
20	24	1092.927	1094.412	1.485		Let me go check

20	24	1130.019	1130.58	0.561		No	
20	24	1131.339	1132.824	1.485	What about any of the corners?

20	24	1144.176	1145.001	0.825	Yeah it does		
20	24	1145.76	1147.476	1.716	Okay we need a few more edges		
20	24	1148.895	1150.083	1.188	Yeah		
20	24	1151.898	1153.152	1.254	It looks like we need one-		
20	24	1153.845	1156.683	2.838	two, three, four, five more edge pieces		
20	24	1158.795	1160.313	1.518	So let's look for some clues		
20	24	1160.775	1162.194	1.419	We got this red crab		
20	24	1162.689	1164.867	2.178	We got the orange octopus		
20	24	1165.692	1167.342	1.65	But that's not an edge piece, right?		
20	24	1169.355	1171.434	2.079	Looks like it goes somewhere nearby, though		
20	24	1172.193	1173.744	1.551	Doesn't have a straight edge on it		
20	24	1176.714	1177.341	0.627	Right?		
20	24	1177.968	1179.387	1.419		It doesn't go there	
20	24	1179.519	1181.862	2.343	We need some straight edged pieces		
20	24	1183.776	1184.898	1.122	mmm		
20	24	1186.68	1188.033	1.353	Maybe this slides over here

20	24	1204.137	1205.259	1.122	NAME		
20	24	1206.843	1207.932	1.089	Look at your puzzle piece		
20	24	1208.493	1209.681	1.188	Where's the straight edge go?

20	24	1213.839	1215.192	1.353			
20	24	1215.588	1219.119	3.531	Good! Okay, now we've got the orange octopus and the gray shark		
20	24	1218.294	1219.515	1.221

20	24	1250.469	1252.482	2.013	I think we're missing two edge pieces		
20	24	1253.439	1255.155	1.716	You wanna do that c- crab?		
20	24	1255.452	1256.145	0.693		Mm-hmm

21	24	153.483	154.902	1.419	Let's find all the pink-		
21	24	156.057	157.872	1.815	Jellyfishy pieces		
21	24	160.875	164.439	3.564	Oh, hey great job!		
21	24	165.066	170.808	5.742	Very good! So now, this looks like it's a corner, here		
21	24	171.204	175.659	4.455	So, should we put it in the, in the tray?		
21	24	175.725	176.286	0.561		Mm-hmm	
21	24	176.319	180.18	3.861	So, where do you think this corner is gonna go? I'll help you lift it		
21	24	179.85	180.081	0.231			
21	24	184.173	184.899	0.726	Okay		
21	24	185.229	192.456	7.227	Yeah, so we'll move it up here, oops, oh, oh boy! oh boy! We're losing our pieces!		
21	24	187.11	188.265	1.155			
21	24	188.793	189.684	0.891			
21	24	194.139	196.053	1.914	Okay, you-		
21	24	195.426	197.34	1.914		It's better if I do it like this, see?	
21	24	197.34	201.498	4.158	Okay, I see. You're doing a great job! So let's see		
21	24	203.082	204.072	0.99		I was right!	
21	24	203.214	203.709	0.495	*sigh*		
21	24	203.544	204.732	1.188			
21	24	204.039	205.326	1.287	You were right!		
21	24	205.986	207.108	1.122	Aah, ok-		
21	24	206.547	207.9	1.353		I wasn't wrong?	
21	24	207.801	212.256	4.455	You were not wrong. So let's see, can you find any more jellyfishy pieces?		
21	24	213.18	216.216	3.036	Some pink jellyfishy pieces, like maybe this one?		
21	24	220.077	221.133	1.056			
21	24	220.869	231.066	10.197	Oh yeah, and the seahorse's nose. Good job. Okay, now, let's see what else there is, there's something blue here, with a blue fin		
21	24	231.759	234.069	2.31	Can you find something that's that color blue?		
21	24	236.775	239.415	2.64	Mmkay, hmm		
21	24	240.471	244.2	3.729	And maybe it's one- Oh oh! Maybe, here try turning that		
21	24	244.926	246.444	1.518	'Cause see here's some pink		
21	24	246.609	247.731	1.122			
21	24	247.665	249.843	2.178	Yeah! Great job		
21	24	250.536	252.912	2.376	Okay so then there's more blue		
21	24	254.958	257.532	2.574	So let's find pieces that have blue		
21	24	257.994	261.327	3.333	And a straight edge, 'cause there'll be a straight edge up here		
21	24	262.185	264.363	2.178	So let's see can you find anything that has blue?		
21	24	265.023	271.26	6.237	I think I see one. And it has blue, and some water drops coming off that look like this		
21	24	272.217	274.494	2.277	Look for some water drops like this		
21	24	275.814	281.028	5.214	Mmm, not quite. L- That's a good guess though, that has some water drops		
21	24	283.239	285.714	2.475	*gasp* try that, okay		
21	24	289.377	290.532	1.155			
21	24	289.707	292.314	2.607	Great! Alright!		
21	24	292.05	294.03	1.98		No, we need it's head	
21	24	294.063	298.386	4.323	Yeah, now we need to find it's head. Maybe there's an eye on it or something		
21	24	299.508	300.795	1.287	Hmm		
21	24	299.904	300.168	0.264			
21	24	303.6	305.217	1.617	It's kind of a toughie		
21	24	307.758	308.847	1.089	mmm		
21	24	308.715	309.276	0.561		Blue!	
21	24	309.54	312.708	3.168	Yeah, you're right that's blue, it's a little bit different color blue		
21	24	313.698	318.252	4.554	Oh, you know what I think it is? I think it's a little bit tricky		
21	24	318.549	329.406	10.857	Because I think this is a swordfish. And so it has a long beak kind of a thing. Can you find something with a long beak on the table?		
21	24	332.706	333.168	0.462		Hmm	
21	24	333.663	334.191	0.528	Hmm		
21	24	333.861	335.511	1.65		This is a little bit tricky	
21	24	335.115	336.93	1.815	It is a tricky puzzle, it is		
21	24	336.996	337.623	0.627		Uh-huh	
21	24	337.656	338.184	0.528	Yeah		
21	24	338.382	339.108	0.726		Mm-hmm	
21	24	338.679	342.243	3.564	So let's see, a long yellow beak		
21	24	340.89	341.517	0.627		A-ha!	
21	24	342.54	343.893	1.353		I think I see one	
21	24	343.893	345.609	1.716	Look, look over on this side		
21	24	346.467	347.655	1.188	Look over here		
21	24	348.546	351.516	2.97	Look over here. Long yellow beak		
21	24	351.813	352.341	0.528		*gasp*	
21	24	353.034	356.862	3.828	Look for something long and yellow. Over here, Look over here		
21	24	359.139	359.898	0.759		Where?	
21	24	360.723	362.406	1.683	Do you see something long and yellow?		
21	24	363.231	366.267	3.036	There you go *gasp* Great job!		
21	24	363.693	364.551	0.858			
21	24	366.201	367.521	1.32		What's the fish saying?	
21	24	366.927	376.398	9.471	"He says ""Thanks for putting me together I need the very tippy end of my nose."" Can you find the very tippy end of this yellow piece? Another yellow piece like that?"		
21	24	377.883	381.447	3.564	*gasp* Wow great job		
21	24	379.005	379.995	0.99			
21	24	381.414	383.922	2.508		Hmm, seems like this black whale	
21	24	383.724	384.846	1.122	Yeah

21	24	400.587	402.336	1.749		Now there's one more piece	
21	24	403.095	409.86	6.765	Yeah, let's see, now okay, now that has a straight edge, so that's gonna go against, yeah yeah yeah! Great!		
21	24	407.781	408.804	1.023			
21	24	411.081	412.038	0.957	Alright		
21	24	412.797	414.645	1.848	So we need some more of this shark		
21	24	415.701	416.724	1.023	Alright		
21	24	417.615	418.539	0.924	Hmm		
21	24	420.288	436.095	15.807	I think, here well, if a piece goes there, it has to have some, here try that piece, where is another- where is another piece of the shark would- would need some, 'cause this- this looks like- Look, it looks like the shark's head with his teeth, so maybe put that towards the front of the shark		
21	24	439.131	441.21	2.079	Yeah yeah yeah, I think- ah no I think you were right		
21	24	443.487	444.477	0.99	Yeah yeah		
21	24	446.259	447.513	1.254		What's the shark say?

21	24	448.041	449.163	1.122			
21	24	451.11	452.232	1.122		What's the shark say?	
21	24	452.133	455.697	3.564	"He says ""Thanks for putting me together I guess I won't eat you up now"""		
21	24	457.215	467.61	10.395	He does need a little bit of his tail, still. So there needs to be a piece with some gray on it. And some orange for the octopus. It'll have a gray nubby part.		
21	24	467.94	470.547	2.607		What's- What's he saying when he can't swim yet?	
21	24	470.448	473.649	3.201	"He says ""I can't swim yet 'cause my tail isn't all together yet"""		
21	24	475.926	476.586	0.66		Hmm	
21	24	476.586	477.444	0.858	Hmm		
21	24	477.378	480.117	2.739		"We say ""Don't worry Mr. Whale, we'll fix you"""

21	24	490.677	492.888	2.211	Don't worry Mr. Whale we'll fix you		
21	24	493.053	494.274	1.221		What's the whale saying?	
21	24	493.779	496.155	2.376	"He says ""Oh I sure hope so"""		
21	24	497.244	501.402	4.158	I think the rest of my tail is on a piece with an eye for an octopus		
21	24	502.062	504.504	2.442	*gasp* Mmm		
21	24	502.491	505.923	3.432		Hmm

21	24	515.328	517.506	2.178	Okay now we need the rest of the octopus		
21	24	517.803	519.189	1.386		What's the- octopus saying?	
21	24	519.288	526.944	7.656	"He says ""Hey put me together. I need all my legs"""		
21	24	527.109	531.432	4.323		"Oh he's- he's supposed to say, ""I need all my legs"""	
21	24	531.036	535.557	4.521	I need all my legs. All eight of them		
21	24	534.864	538.329	3.465		"No! He's supposed to say ""I need my legs"""	
21	24	538.131	541.926	3.795	I need my legs. Please put my legs on me		
21	24	539.88	540.111	0.231

21	24	544.665	545.556	0.891	Great		
21	24	545.721	547.899	2.178		What's he saying when he can't swim yet?	
21	24	547.47	551.232	3.762	"He says ""I can't- I still can't swim yet! I need more legs!"""		
21	24	553.41	554.631	1.221			
21	24	554.73	555.951	1.221		Now what's he saying?	
21	24	555.918	558.69	2.772	"Now he says ""Oh! Almost all my legs!"""		
21	24	562.947	566.049	3.102	I think there's a starfish with its legs		
21	24	567.336	568.029	0.693		*gasp*	
21	24	568.92	570.438	1.518		What's the starfish saying?	
21	24	570.669	573.507	2.838	Oh, try it in the corner. See how it's a corner?		
21	24	578.028	579.018	0.99			
21	24	578.919	580.833	1.914	Great job. Okay		
21	24	579.843	581.394	1.551		What's- What's he say?	
21	24	581.823	588.984	7.161	"The starfish is saying ""Oh, thanks for putting me together!"" Now it looks like there's going to be something with some sand and some purple stuff"		
21	24	589.842	593.571	3.729	So look for some purple anemone things		
21	24	594.132	596.211	2.079	Oh yeah, there's a good one		
21	24	597.762	600.633	2.871		It's a purple, and a anemone thing?	
21	24	600.567	601.491	0.924	Anemone		
21	24	602.976	603.603	0.627		Why?

21	24	608.421	610.104	1.683		Of the amanemone?	
21	24	609.642	615.417	5.775	No no no no. You're right, you're right. Here, leave these together. But see how there's a straight edge here? Where's the straight edge on this piece?		
21	24	616.143	616.605	0.462		*noises*	
21	24	616.308	618.981	2.673	Yeah, so here, turn it so the straight edge matches		
21	24	619.806	620.862	1.056			
21	24	620.763	622.38	1.617	There! Good job!		
21	24	622.809	623.469	0.66		There	
21	24	623.436	628.353	4.917	Now is there more purple somewhere? Can you see more purple, and sand somewhere?		
21	24	636.471	642.081	5.61	That has some purple but it doesn't have d- Oh, oh look at you! Yeah!		
21	24	639.606	640.86	1.254			
21	24	642.609	644.061	1.452		What's the octopus saying?	
21	24	643.962	649.407	5.445	"He says ""Thank you so much"" You put all the octopus together. Now we gotta finish up the anemone"		
21	24	650.694	652.575	1.881		What's an, anemyenemy	
21	24	652.707	656.799	4.092	*laughing* an anemone? It's like a weird under-sea thing that has lots of-		
21	24	658.119	659.307	1.188	Things like that		
21	24	660.429	661.881	1.452	*gasp* Yeah

21	24	684.783	687.456	2.673	Hmm, I don't think that's quite right		
21	24	689.568	690.591	1.023	Oh!

21	24	695.937	697.818	1.881	It sure does, look at that!		
21	24	697.818	699.006	1.188		*laughing* Is that neat!	
21	24	698.676	699.996	1.32	That is neat!		
21	24	700.425	701.25	0.825		##	
21	24	700.491	705.705	5.214	Okay, now it looks like something with some gray and blue together		
21	24	706.893	707.982	1.089	Okay		
21	24	706.992	708.543	1.551		That is gray and blue!	
21	24	708.576	713.229	4.653	You're right! And what about this, see how these are gray and this color blue?		
21	24	713.658	715.968	2.31	So we've got just a couple more pieces		
21	24	715.902	719.4	3.498		mmm mmm mmm mmm	
21	24	717.585	719.301	1.716	Oh, yeah, ##

22	48	124.08	127.6	3.52	I don't know. They just are. Okay here, you wanna help me put it together?		
22	48	128.8	129.68	0.88	Do those go together?		
22	48	132.04	133.56	1.52	Oh, we're missing pieces		
22	48	135.04	136.16	1.12	There's pieces under there		
22	48	136.72	137.36	0.64	'Kay		
22	48	139.16	141.48	2.32	I remember this guy was down here somewhere		
22	48	144.32	145.24	0.92	Oh there we go		
22	48	145.76	147.52	1.76	Maybe he wasn't down there, maybe her was up there		
22	48	153.12	153.8	0.68	What do ya think?		
22	48	154.84	155.72	0.88	Are you gonna do any?		
22	48	157.2	159.64	2.44	Why don't you start putting the piece togeth- the puzzle together?		
22	48	159.48	164.96	5.48		I- I stopped putting the puzzle together to drink my water	
22	48	164.88	166.72	1.84	*laughing* You sure did. That's okay		
22	48	167.6	169.6	2.0	I wonder if we could find a corner piece		
22	48	170.24	171.96	1.72		I- Where's the toys?	
22	48	172.6	173.28	0.68	I don't know		
22	48	174.0	175.88	1.88	Hey, is this one a corner piece?		
22	48	176.48	177.84	1.36		Mmm yes	
22	48	178.04	180.36	2.32	Yeah? So what do we think, should it go in that corner?		
22	48	181.64	184.8	3.16	Do we think goes in that corner, that corner		
22	48	185.8	187.4	1.6	'Kay, let's # it out		
22	48	186.48	192.48	6.0		Maybe... Maybe... It goes in that corner. It goes in that corner	
22	48	189.92	190.12	0.2			
22	48	192.6	195.44	2.84	Yeah? Goes in that corner? What about this one, where did that one go?		
22	48	196.6	200.8	4.2		I n- I'm going to drink for a little while	
22	48	201.08	203.68	2.6	Well, but let's put the put- puzzle together		
22	48	206.76	208.04	1.28	Where do you think that one would go?		
22	48	210.8	211.88	1.08	Yeah, there we go		
22	48	212.64	214.16	1.52	Where else is part of the butterfly?		
22	48	215.24	216.0	0.76		###	
22	48	216.68	217.92	1.24		In this picture	
22	48	216.72	219.92	3.2	'Bout that one? Yeah, where does that one go, you think?		
22	48	218.76	219.36	0.6		Um	
22	48	220.48	221.16	0.68		Hmm	
22	48	221.24	222.28	1.04	uh uh		
22	48	221.88	224.6	2.72		Maybe somewhere around the butterfly	
22	48	224.68	225.88	1.2	Where, maybe up here?		
22	48	227.84	228.68	0.84	Mmm		
22	48	228.96	230.84	1.88		Mmm, maybe	
22	48	230.96	232.36	1.4	Maybe we're not ready for that piece		
22	48	235.8	236.76	0.96	Ooh, What about this one?		
22	48	237.64	238.8	1.16	That goes there, huh?		
22	48	239.32	241.28	1.96		Mm-hmm	
22	48	242.08	243.64	1.56	That's an edge piece, right?		
22	48	246.32	247.68	1.36	Nope, that doesn't work		
22	48	249.16	249.76	0.6	Hmm		
22	48	251.36	251.88	0.52	*gasp*		
22	48	253.36	254.16	0.8	Does that go there?		
22	48	255.76	257.56	1.8		Think it does	
22	48	257.76	259.68	1.92	Sorta looks like it might, doesn't it?		
22	48	260.76	263.92	3.16	What else? Where else is there blue butterfly? What about that one?		
22	48	266.16	267.32	1.16	Does that have blue butterfly?		
22	48	271.4	272.32	0.92	Ooh, does that go?		
22	48	273.64	274.2	0.56		Yep!	
22	48	273.92	278.6	4.68	It does, but hmm. Is that right? Is that how a nose goes?		
22	48	278.88	280.12	1.24		No	
22	48	279.76	283.12	3.36	No, so we gotta turn it. Will you turn it so that it's facing the right way?		
22	48	283.88	287.28	3.4	No I think it's together, it's # the right way, but maybe this is in the wrong corner		
22	48	289.32	290.84	1.52	Maybe we should turn the puzzle		
22	48	293.4	295.28	1.88	Maybe it needs to go like that, huh?		
22	48	298.16	299.48	1.32	Yeah, ##		
22	48	298.48	300.16	1.68			
22	48	299.12	300.96	1.84		Think you're right, mama	
22	48	302.52	304.84	2.32	There's part of the butterfly, where's that go?		
22	48	302.76	303.68	0.92		Think you're right	
22	48	309.88	310.16	0.28			
22	48	310.2	311.92	1.72	Oh, good job, there you go		
22	48	311.2	314.12	2.92		What- What's that on the butterfly?	
22	48	313.4	315.44	2.04	Oh, that's not quite right though, is it?		
22	48	315.44	317.32	1.88		What's that on the butterfly?	
22	48	318.88	320.8	1.92	I don't know, but that one was not quite right		
22	48	322.32	323.0	0.68	What's that?		
22	48	323.44	324.64	1.2		A tiger	
22	48	326.16	327.12	0.96	Hmm		
22	48	327.76	330.2	2.44		A tiger it's a tiger	
22	48	330.12	331.28	1.16	That's not a tiger		
22	48	331.76	333.48	1.72		It's a tiger	
22	48	333.72	337.8	4.08	Here, come on, start putting some pieces together. Oh look, Hey- What's that?		
22	48	335.44	336.8	1.36		###	
22	48	337.96	338.8	0.84		A leopard	
22	48	338.8	341.28	2.48	Yeah, what else is- what- but what part of the leopard?		
22	48	346.56	349.56	3.0		The, uh, eye	
22	48	349.24	350.56	1.32	The eye, that's right		
22	48	350.84	352.4	1.56		The eye part of the leopard	
22	48	352.48	353.28	0.8	Yeah		
22	48	354.92	356.96	2.04	So where does the eye part of- go usually?		
22	48	357.0	357.6	0.6		*gasp*	
22	48	358.12	359.56	1.44	Above or below the nose?		
22	48	360.96	364.92	3.96		I found... A piece- some part of the butterfly	
22	48	365.8	367.48	1.68		But it doesn't go there	
22	48	367.44	370.88	3.44	Well try it, try it again, maybe it does. *gasp* You're right, it doesn't		
22	48	371.24	373.08	1.84	'Cause that's not butterfly, right?		
22	48	374.2	374.64	0.44	#		
22	48	374.2	378.72	4.52		Yeah but there's a part, butterfly in- on the edge	
22	48	379.6	380.88	1.28	Yeah, let's see		
22	48	381.44	382.24	0.8	Here look at this		
22	48	383.8	385.32	1.52		Can you push me in?	
22	48	385.36	387.12	1.76	Yeah, of course, buddy		
22	48	387.84	433.16	45.32		*noises*	
22	48	389.32	391.32	2.0	What's that part? Yeah, there you go		
22	48	394.96	396.52	1.56			
22	48	397.48	398.28	0.8	Hmm		
22	48	399.92	401.28	1.36	Okay, what else?		
22	48	403.16	405.04	1.88	You think maybe this'll fit in there now?		
22	48	407.28	407.92	0.64	Hmm		
22	48	408.92	411.24	2.32	No, it just doesn't, does it?		
22	48	412.2	414.28	2.08	Let's see, what else can we find of that leopard?		
22	48	420.56	421.04	0.48	Hmm		
22	48	434.16	435.52	1.36		What was that noise?	
22	48	435.92	436.8	0.88	I don't know		
22	48	437.24	439.0	1.76		*noises*	
22	48	440.56	443.0	2.44		Hmm, nope!	
22	48	443.28	444.04	0.76	Hmm		
22	48	449.32	453.28	3.96		That piece goes in like that, I think	
22	48	454.4	456.8	2.4		Hmm, maybe not	
22	48	457.64	459.08	1.44	Mmm, here's more leopard		
22	48	459.48	460.72	1.24	Are we missing some leopard?		
22	48	461.56	463.76	2.2	Oh, see we're missing some leopard, here		
22	48	464.72	466.16	1.44	There's another eyes		
22	48	473.84	477.0	3.16	There we go, now we got all the eyes		
22	48	480.04	481.12	1.08	There you go!		
22	48	480.88	482.28	1.4			
22	48	483.36	485.88	2.52	That's looking good, and look there's butterfly on that one!		
22	48	487.12	489.4	2.28			
22	48	489.44	490.64	1.2	Do you think they match up?		
22	48	490.8	491.4	0.6		Yep!	
22	48	491.52	494.12	2.6	So what about that piece? Does that piece match up over there?		
22	48	492.28	517.2	24.92		*noises*	
22	48	496.12	499.96	3.84	What do you think? Why don't you push it together?		
22	48	502.36	504.04	1.68	It did! It did!		
22	48	505.12	505.68	0.56	So		
22	48	506.08	507.48	1.4			
22	48	508.4	512.12	3.72	That does go there. How come it didn't work before? That was really weird		
22	48	513.28	517.48	4.2	Okay, what about, *gasp* Is that right?		
22	48	513.96	515.48	1.52			
22	48	517.64	518.4	0.76		Yep!	
22	48	518.28	518.96	0.68	Yep		
22	48	521.6	524.2	2.6	Oh, look at this piece, Oh, look at that!		
22	48	525.2	526.84	1.64			
22	48	525.64	526.6	0.96	Good job		
22	48	525.76	529.72	3.96		Uhh, that one was a little bit tricky	
22	48	529.68	530.92	1.24	That one was a little tricky		
22	48	531.76	534.92	3.16	I'm looking for another piece though, we're missing a piece		
22	48	535.44	536.56	1.12	That would go right there		
22	48	537.32	538.64	1.32	*gasp* maybe		
22	48	539.28	540.0	0.72	Look at that		
22	48	540.68	544.44	3.76	Why do I think that might work? What's shape- Does it match that shape? 		
22	48	543.84	552.52	8.68		Um, I think so. It sure does. Hey! That looks like part of a cow!	
22	48	545.08	546.6	1.52	You see the hole?		
22	48	545.76	547.28	1.52			
22	48	547.16	548.4	1.24	Yeah, sure does		
22	48	549.84	550.12	0.28			
22	48	549.88	550.6	0.72	Look at that		
22	48	552.68	556.2	3.52	Sure does. Hey, look, does that fit in that spot right there?		
22	48	554.64	559.92	5.28		*noises*	
22	48	558.16	559.4	1.24			
22	48	560.44	561.48	1.04	It does		
22	48	561.32	562.68	1.36		What's that?	
22	48	563.28	566.04	2.76	Looks like a leaf, a pretty flower, doe- Isn't it?		
22	48	565.96	569.6	3.64		*noises*	
22	48	567.44	571.2	3.76	Hmm, this looks like part of the cat, maybe, it's the rest of his what?		
22	48	570.56	572.16	1.6			
22	48	571.28	573.12	1.84		That... a leopard	
22	48	572.8	575.44	2.64	Oh sorry, the leopard, what's- What part of that, is it?		
22	48	576.0	578.44	2.44		Umm, His ear	
22	48	578.16	579.08	0.92	*laughing* His ear		
22	48	579.76	582.88	3.12		Now, let's see if this fits here	
22	48	583.8	584.96	1.16	Oh, nope		
22	48	584.04	584.92	0.88		Mmm	
22	48	587.6	589.2	1.6	Yeah, we know that fits together		
22	48	594.16	595.24	1.08	What about this over here?		
22	48	599.64	603.56	3.92	Now I remember the ants were kind of in- down below here somewhere		
22	48	604.08	605.04	0.96	Do you remember that?		
22	48	605.84	606.32	0.48		No	
22	48	606.48	606.92	0.44	No?		
22	48	609.08	611.8	2.72	What do we think that is? Is that- that's the toucan's #?		
22	48	611.96	612.56	0.6		Yeah	
22	48	612.84	615.56	2.72	Yeah? Here, hold on, is that part of the toucan?		
22	48	617.56	618.52	0.96		Yep	
22	48	621.36	623.16	1.8		That's part of the toucan	
22	48	624.04	626.08	2.04	Hmm, maybe that toucan doesn't belong up here		
22	48	627.44	630.52	3.08	Maybe he's over here somewhere or something, I don't know		
22	48	633.84	636.48	2.64	Mmm, *gasp* Does that # go together?		
22	48	637.04	637.76	0.72	No		
22	48	640.48	643.16	2.68	Hmm. Oh, here's a spot		
22	48	644.04	644.64	0.6	Try it-		
22	48	645.08	646.64	1.56			
22	48	645.44	646.92	1.48		That's a leopard	
22	48	646.88	647.68	0.8	Yeah		
22	48	648.04	648.68	0.64		Uh	
22	48	648.68	649.88	1.2	Oh, what does that look like?		
22	48	650.28	653.0	2.72		Mmm, a butterfly	
22	48	653.12	653.8	0.68	No		
22	48	655.48	656.8	1.32		Um, a-	
22	48	656.44	657.44	1.0	Frog toe?		
22	48	658.2	658.84	0.64	Toes?		
22	48	661.36	666.2	4.84		Mmm, Uhh, it looks like a tree frog	
22	48	661.76	663.64	1.88			
22	48	664.08	664.44	0.36	*gasp*		
22	48	665.88	667.96	2.08	Yeah! So let's find more frog stuff		
22	48	669.04	672.28	3.24	There's some frog things over there. Let's see if we can find more frogs		
22	48	671.96	673.2	1.24			
22	48	672.8	673.96	1.16	*gasp* look at that		
22	48	674.88	676.28	1.4		Is that a tree frog?	
22	48	676.44	677.36	0.92	Yeah		
22	48	677.8	678.8	1.0	I think it is		
22	48	685.24	688.44	3.2	That doesn't go there. Maybe we'll put him over here		
22	48	691.0	693.08	2.08	Where- Okay let's look for more frogs		
22	48	696.24	698.36	2.12		I found a little baby frog	
22	48	698.52	702.64	4.12	Yeah? So let's see if you can find a place for him- that baby frog to go		
22	48	703.84	704.88	1.04		Hmm	
22	48	707.48	708.8	1.32			
22	48	714.52	715.32	0.8	Where else?		
22	48	716.32	717.6	1.28	Oh, I bet this-		
22	48	719.36	720.8	1.44	Goes *gasp* Look!		
22	48	723.96	725.68	1.72			
22	48	725.4	725.96	0.56	*gasp*		
22	48	726.8	727.48	0.68	Does that work?		
22	48	727.8	728.32	0.52		Yep	
22	48	728.2	728.92	0.72	What's that?		
22	48	730.32	732.52	2.2		Looks like a crocodile	
22	48	732.64	734.56	1.92	W- Are crocodiles in the trees?

26	24	644.556	650.133	5.577	But it's not gonna go here, because there's nothing for it to connect to, ### not gonna go here, 'cause there's nothing for it to connect to. So it's gonna be somewhere in the middle here		
26	24	651.123	651.618	0.495	But		
26	24	651.189	653.4	2.211		But you said, everything would be here	
26	24	653.268	660.033	6.765	Everything is gonna be on the edge, it's gonna be somewhere on this edge, but something else is gonna be here and something else is gonna be here. Can you figure out?

26	24	684.189	687.984	3.795	I think I see a piece that might connect to it but I'm not sure		
26	24	690.459	697.323	6.864	Well, you know it's gonna be on this edge, right? So it's either this piece or this piece or this piece. Make sure you line the edge up and see if it fits somewhere

26	24	746.856	748.341	1.485		We made the frame	
26	24	748.242	758.142	9.9	We did make the frame, and, it looks like this might be the easiest place to start, 'cause this- this octopus looks pretty, uh, pretty distinct. Can you see pieces of the octopus in here?		
26	24	760.419	761.112	0.693		Lots of them	
26	24	761.211	762.069	0.858	Well, put 'em in

35	48	261.624	265.782	4.158	That looks like it goes in another corner. Maybe in this corner? Or that corner?		
35	48	266.97	268.059	1.089	Or maybe this corner		
35	48	272.019	272.811	0.792		Right here	
35	48	273.009	273.999	0.99	You think it goes there?		
35	48	275.022	276.87	1.848		We can move a little right there	
35	48	276.969	277.695	0.726	'Kay		
35	48	278.553	279.576	1.023	Where do you think that goes?

35	48	319.902	321.651	1.749	But I think it might go better up there		
35	48	323.697	324.621	0.924	Try turning it		
35	48	325.182	326.337	1.155		I did it	
35	48	326.535	332.904	6.369	*laughing* It's good but the colors don't quite go. Let's try turning it one more time, that way

35	48	386.364	387.882	1.518	Put the blue close to the blue		
35	48	392.271	392.931	0.66	###		
35	48	393.525	394.845	1.32		Where is it?	
35	48	395.076	397.089	2.013	Let's see, where's the bl- Where's the blue over here?

37	48	543.675	545.094	1.419	I think it's on the board here		
37	48	545.952	546.843	0.891	Yes		
37	48	547.503	548.757	1.254			
37	48	548.625	551.958	3.333	Good! It's coming along		
37	48	553.245	554.664	1.419	Where do you think that could go?		
37	48	553.905	554.169	0.264			
37	48	557.205	558.36	1.155	Try a different spot		
37	48	561.726	568.557	6.831	Do you see another kind of... cut-out hole, where some- yes.		
37	48	569.679	570.702	1.023			
37	48	570.966	572.352	1.386	Very good		
37	48	572.451	574.992	2.541		Now can we play hide-and-seek?	
37	48	574.101	576.84	2.739	Well, we have to finish this puzzle and one more		
37	48	579.942	581.031	1.089		And then go?	
37	48	580.965	581.922	0.957	*laughing* Yeah		
37	48	582.78	588.885	6.105	Let's see. Umm, see how this has- it's kinda yellow with black spots?		
37	48	590.106	594.363	4.257	Where on the puzzle do you see some yellow and black spots that needs finishing?		
37	48	599.577	601.755	2.178	That's it. That's it		
37	48	601.656	603.009	1.353			
37	48	603.504	608.718	5.214	Ooh and I think I see part of a snake's head up above. That's kind of exciting		
37	48	609.543	611.853	2.31	Let's see, is there more of the snake?		
37	48	612.711	615.813	3.102	Ooh, this looks like part of a snake		
37	48	620.928	622.281	1.353		Ta-da!	
37	48	621.885	623.304	1.419	*laughing* What's that?		
37	48	624.459	627.231	2.772		###	
37	48	624.624	627.495	2.871	Uh-huh, it's a little too close for me to see it like that		
37	48	630.564	639.111	8.547	I'm not sure where that piece goes. W- Here's how, um, I think we can finish the puzzle. If we go animal by animal. So right now, we're working on-		
37	48	639.342	644.16	4.818	We're finishing up this cheetah, and also we can work on the big snake up here. That's part of his head		
37	48	644.325	646.008	1.683		But I see teeth	
37	48	646.206	647.196	0.99	I do too		
37	48	647.394	653.07	5.676		Maybe it's, um, a dra- Maybe it's a crocodile	
37	48	653.202	655.743	2.541	Let's keep building the puzzle and then we'll see for sure		
37	48	656.931	661.32	4.389	Um, I think this looks like part of the snake. And also this		
37	48	663.432	667.491	4.059	You wanna see if there's a way it can go to build the snake more?		
37	48	669.141	671.055	1.914	Maybe not there. Try a different spot		
37	48	673.134	675.411	2.277		I want you to do it	
37	48	674.091	677.556	3.465	Well you're doing it. They wanna see how you do it. How we do it together		
37	48	678.645	680.229	1.584		How	
37	48	678.975	680.361	1.386	That's it. That's it		
37	48	680.592	681.714	1.122			
37	48	681.318	682.308	0.99	You just did it		
37	48	683.034	683.661	0.627	Super		
37	48	684.651	685.344	0.693	Okay		
37	48	685.542	685.938	0.396		Um	
37	48	688.611	689.205	0.594	Alright		
37	48	689.733	694.617	4.884	We're making good progress. Do you see this piece? And how it has a flat piece on top?		
37	48	694.881	696.63	1.749		*noises*	
37	48	696.531	698.346	1.815	This might go at the very top		
37	48	699.567	702.075	2.508		*noises*	
37	48	701.316	703.428	2.112	Might have to kneel up a little bit		
37	48	704.319	705.606	1.287			
37	48	704.649	705.441	0.792	That's it		
37	48	706.068	710.952	4.884	Great. Now, this gives us a place to start building the top, too!		
37	48	708.246	708.807	0.561		###	
37	48	710.292	715.44	5.148		*noises*	
37	48	713.625	717.75	4.125	Okay, Um, Let's see, Where-		
37	48	716.364	720.753	4.389		*noises* ###	
37	48	720.159	723.888	3.729	We need more of the snake, and we need more of this cheetah		
37	48	722.568	724.548	1.98		### one	
37	48	724.878	735.669	10.791		*noises* *singing* butterfly, butterfly, butter- butter- butterfly, butterfly	
37	48	725.175	726.363	1.188	There's nothing under here		
37	48	727.617	733.326	5.709	Let's see. This looks like part of a cheetah. See how p- it's part of a spot?		
37	48	742.335	743.358	1.023			
37	48	743.094	744.117	1.023	Mm-hmm		
37	48	744.447	747.318	2.871		NAME	
37	48	747.021	750.981	3.96	I think he's just playing with some toys in there. Okay look at this big green leaf here		
37	48	751.476	755.172	3.696	This looks like part of that leaf and this looks like part of a leaf		
37	48	758.109	759.231	1.122	Try a different way		
37	48	759.429	763.686	4.257		*noises* Oh	
37	48	763.092	766.953	3.861	Yep. Probably that got torn. Okay, let's try to turn it a little bit		
37	48	768.075	769.164	1.089	That's it		
37	48	774.345	775.335	0.99	Good		
37	48	777.678	780.714	3.036	That's it, right there. You found the right place		
37	48	783.387	785.664	2.277		*noises*	
37	48	783.717	784.938	1.221	Well at least I thought you did		
37	48	787.38	796.62	9.24	You know what? Mommy is wrong. It looks like it goes there, doesn't it? But it actually doesn't. So let's try this piece. Let's see if this piece fits		
37	48	792.165	797.412	5.247		*noises*	
37	48	793.881	794.112	0.231			
37	48	798.171	799.26	1.089			
37	48	798.897	800.019	1.122	That fits		
37	48	800.514	802.56	2.046	Okay, so this must go somewhere else		
37	48	803.286	804.111	0.825	Umm		
37	48	806.52	810.381	3.861	Hmm, okay. This looks like- What animal do you think these belong to?		
37	48	811.437	812.196	0.759	Any ideas?		
37	48	816.948	821.733	4.785	Maybe a little tree frog. Okay, what- What is this animal that likes to eat leaves?		
37	48	823.977	824.472	0.495	Hmm?		
37	48	827.277	828.102	0.825	What could that be?		
37	48	828.993	830.049	1.056		A crab	
37	48	830.379	831.105	0.726	Crab?		
37	48	831.798	841.5	9.702	Well, it's kind of reddish like some of our pictures of crabs, but I think it's an ant. Let's get all the ant pieces together and see if we can do the ant		
37	48	831.897	833.349	1.452		Cra-	
37	48	840.048	842.655	2.607		*noises*

37	48	843.843	849.42	5.577		*noises*	
37	48	860.838	864.468	3.63	Well, could this be part of the ant? Maybe that's part of his mouth		
37	48	864.732	865.986	1.254			
37	48	865.821	869.847	4.026	Mmm, okay. And look at these pieces, I think they're the legs		
37	48	870.837	871.959	1.122	Where could that piece go?		
37	48	877.8	878.592	0.792	That's it		
37	48	879.384	880.473	1.089			
37	48	880.176	880.803	0.627	Good		
37	48	881.595	882.519	0.924	How bout this piece?		
37	48	886.974	888.129	1.155			
37	48	887.997	888.657	0.66	Good		
37	48	889.416	893.013	3.597	Alright, any more ant pieces? We're making great progress		
37	48	893.871	895.29	1.419	Umm

37	48	904.761	905.421	0.66	###		
37	48	904.893	906.378	1.485		Think there's only two	
37	48	907.005	911.163	4.158	Well something must go here, something kind of reddish. Oh- This one		
37	48	911.196	912.681	1.485			
37	48	912.648	915.948	3.3	Okay, now we're on the red, umm		
37	48	913.836	914.1	0.264			15:00 - 22 Pieces
37	48	919.809	922.68	2.871	The red plant. That's it. Where could this go?		
37	48	919.908	921.063	1.155			
37	48	922.977	924.132	1.155

37	48	930.699	933.306	2.607		### what's this ###	
37	48	933.735	944.229	10.494	Looks like some bird is eating a cherry or something. Look at this leaf. You see how there's green leaf both of these places? Maybe this piece goes around here		
37	48	946.407	947.463	1.056			
37	48	947.925	948.75	0.825	Mm-hmm		
37	48	949.938	953.766	3.828	Okay, and, what if this is part of a frog?		
37	48	954.624	957.066	2.442	Do you see part of a- a frog anywhere?		
37	48	960.399	961.389	0.99	Yes		
37	48	966.042	967.164	1.122

37	48	968.748	970.266	1.518	Coming along		
37	48	971.124	977.493	6.369	Let's see, so we need part of a green leaf here, and maybe there's another frog nearby		
37	48	979.143	983.235	4.092	Or maybe not. Let's see. Umm		
37	48	988.152	994.785	6.633	Ooh I think I see a piece with a tiny bit of red. Maybe this can connect here		
37	48	994.026	995.148	1.122			
37	48	995.577	998.316	2.739	Okay, so now...

37	48	1013.925	1018.413	4.488	Think you need a piece with a flat edge. Is there anything with a f- yeah		
37	48	1019.106	1020.261	1.155			
37	48	1019.898	1022.802	2.904	Mm-hmm. And now maybe this can connect		
37	48	1032.075	1032.669	0.594	That's it		
37	48	1033.494	1034.649	1.155

37	48	1118.403	1121.01	2.607	Look at this. Where- where do you think this piece could go?		
37	48	1126.917	1127.676	0.759	Very good		
37	48	1128.831	1129.92	1.089

37	48	1168.101	1170.774	2.673	This to me looks like part of that snake		
37	48	1173.579	1177.242	3.663	See the snake's on this side? Ooh, good		
37	48	1175.592	1176.516	0.924

37	48	1181.598	1182.918	1.32	See some red over here?		
37	48	1184.436	1185.426	0.99	Let's work on that		
37	48	1186.746	1190.904	4.158	Here's some red, yep. I think we're- we're on here now

37	48	1201.167	1204.467	3.3	Well, these three pieces probably go around here somewhere		
37	48	1208.394	1209.78	1.386			
37	48	1208.955	1209.582	0.627	Great		
37	48	1214.301	1215.291	0.99	Where else could it go?

37	48	1217.502	1218.624	1.122

37	48	1234.2	1236.807	2.607	Getting close, you need a flat edge up there

37	24	1956.966	1958.022	1.056	What- What could go here?		
37	24	1958.88	1959.771	0.891	That's it		
37	24	1961.949	1963.104	1.155			
37	24	1963.038	1963.731	0.693	Nice		
37	24	1964.82	1967.196	2.376	Okay, any other orange pieces?		
37	24	1968.615	1968.912	0.297		Uh

37	24	1982.508	1984.092	1.584	Your puzzle's more than half-way done!		
37	24	1992.045	1998.315	6.27	Well y- I do see pink there, but since this has a flat edge, it probably has to go over here		
37	24	1999.899	2004.189	4.29	Probably right around there. Why don't you find another piece with pink that could maybe go in the middle		
37	24	2006.103	2008.017	1.914	That looks like a corner piece		
37	24	2008.941	2010.03	1.089			
37	24	2009.799	2013.99	4.191	So there's probably something that goes in between and connects these two		
37	24	2017.455	2019.963	2.508		Maybe this	
37	24	2019.501	2024.385	4.884	Well this doesn't have a flat edge. Why don't you see if it could connect with the pink over here		
37	24	2028.576	2031.447	2.871	Ooh, that looks- That looks good because see the blue?		
37	24	2030.358	2031.777	1.419			
37	24	2032.239	2036.76	4.521	Mm-hmm. And then maybe this goes down here like that		
37	24	2037.915	2038.806	0.891	We'll see		
37	24	2039.499	2040.093	0.594		But	
37	24	2039.928	2041.314	1.386	Or maybe it goes up here		
37	24	2042.172	2044.581	2.409	Maybe it's the top. That's it		
37	24	2045.307	2046.594	1.287			
37	24	2047.881	2048.64	0.759	Great		
37	24	2055.306	2057.286	1.98		What does this go to?	
37	24	2058.144	2060.586	2.442	Well, is that the head of a seahorse?		
37	24	2060.718	2061.939	1.221			
37	24	2066.328	2067.516	1.188	Mm-hmm		
37	24	2066.493	2067.681	1.188			
37	24	2073.72	2074.974	1.254			
37	24	2074.875	2075.568	0.693	Nice		
37	24	2081.013	2081.838	0.825		Maybe um	
37	24	2083.29	2085.303	2.013		I'm working on a whale	
37	24	2085.204	2086.128	0.924	Yes		
37	24	2089.857	2092.134	2.277	Do you see this little bit of pink?		
37	24	2094.543	2095.698	1.155			
37	24	2094.675	2095.5	0.825	That's it		
37	24	2099.262	2100.45	1.188			
37	24	2100.087	2100.351	0.264			24 Piece - End
38	48	62.865	63.129	0.264			48 Piece - Start
38	48	62.898	63.657	0.759	Let's go!		
38	48	64.845	67.551	2.706		First we gotta take the puzzle-	
38	48	67.848	69.135	1.287	Okay		
38	48	69.432	73.854	4.422		Break them *laughing* Then we gotta mix them up	
38	48	73.458	74.349	0.891	Okay		
38	48	79.068	80.388	1.32	Alrighty		
38	48	79.563	83.721	4.158		But ### we take the pieces out	
38	48	83.688	84.381	0.693	Mm-hmm		
38	48	93.489	95.601	2.112	Alright, ###		
38	48	96.063	100.155	4.092		A lot of pieces, because they're so little and tiny	
38	48	96.987	97.944	0.957	Mm-hmm		
38	48	99.792	100.782	0.99	Mm-hmm		
38	48	103.29	104.049	0.759	###		
38	48	103.422	107.085	3.663		Now let's get ### now let's mix them up	
38	48	107.118	111.87	4.752	Okay, I think they're- Oh, here, I think they're mixed up enough, okay. Ooh		
38	48	110.616	116.193	5.577		Uh-oh. I dropped me some pieces. Uh-oh I dropped me some pieces	
38	48	118.965	119.856	0.891	Okay		
38	48	120.285	120.978	0.693		There	
38	48	120.78	121.572	0.792	Alright		
38	48	122.595	123.387	0.792	###		
38	48	122.694	124.938	2.244		Alrighty. What is that, Mommy?	
38	48	122.892	123.123	0.231			
38	48	124.707	126.588	1.881	Those are the mints. I don't think you like those		
38	48	129.228	129.987	0.759	You want one?		
38	48	130.845	131.439	0.594	Okay		
38	48	134.079	138.105	4.026	Aah, that's my finger! *laughing* Alright, how are you gonna get started?		
38	48	138.171	139.524	1.353		Why do you get two?	
38	48	139.689	141.834	2.145	Because I'm a big person. Let's go		
38	48	143.451	144.606	1.155	So, where should we start?		
38	48	145.167	146.223	1.056	Let's see		
38	48	145.959	146.652	0.693		Up here!	
38	48	146.718	147.312	0.594	Up here?		
38	48	147.675	152.889	5.214	So how do we know what goes up there? Ooh, I just remember it's a jungle and a bunch of animals		
38	48	154.11	160.908	6.798	Well, I don't know, this probably goes at the top, but I don't think it goes over there. Right, 'cause it has a flat top?		
38	48	162.723	164.406	1.683	So what else has a flat top?		
38	48	165.099	167.013	1.914		Uhh, this!	
38	48	167.079	168.3	1.221	Okay, let's see		
38	48	171.699	174.075	2.376	Alright, some more flat- any more flat tops?		
38	48	175.725	178.662	2.937	Oh, I have some more. What about that one? Where might that one go?		
38	48	180.51	184.437	3.927	### has a- Yeah, so that one would go in the corner. Nice		
38	48	185.559	189.651	4.092	Hmm. You- You have some, well we got a lot of flat pieces		
38	48	190.278	191.004	0.726		This one	
38	48	190.278	191.631	1.353	### this one, I don't know		
38	48	192.621	194.568	1.947	Let's see. Is that a flat top?		
38	48	200.541	202.686	2.145	I'm not sure if this one goes at the top or the bottom		
38	48	203.775	204.534	0.759	Hmm		
38	48	207.273	208.395	1.122	And this one too		
38	48	210.012	212.751	2.739	Oh well, Hmm, this one looks like a flower?		
38	48	213.939	216.183	2.244		I think these go together	
38	48	224.235	224.829	0.594	Hmm		
38	48	229.746	234.696	4.95	Well, it was a good idea. Not quite, but that's a good idea. Should we find some more of those?		
38	48	235.587	237.501	1.914	Do we have any more of those with the red?		
38	48	238.557	240.57	2.013	Let's put 'em all together so we can see 'em		
38	48	242.418	244.959	2.541	And this one- Yeah, this one red too		
38	48	242.781	243.507	0.726		Red	
38	48	242.88	243.111	0.231			
38	48	244.827	245.85	1.023		Here's some red too

38	48	257.004	257.565	0.561	Nope		
38	48	262.119	267.3	5.181	Oh this- Oh yeah it doesn't. This has these little pointy pieces. Does one of those fit over there?		
38	48	271.293	272.877	1.584	Mmm, try it the other way		
38	48	276.54	277.464	0.924	Nope		
38	48	278.586	279.972	1.386	Nope, see that doesn't match		
38	48	280.962	282.447	1.485	You got one side left		
38	48	283.602	285.417	1.815		This one ###	
38	48	284.46	285.45	0.99	No, this one		
38	48	286.308	286.77	0.462		Yep	
38	48	289.08	293.04	3.96	Now we just gotta figure out which corner it goes in, we're not really su- Wait, ###		
38	48	293.403	294.294	0.891		This one	
38	48	294.261	296.241	1.98	You think that one? Okay, we'll start there		
38	48	296.637	300.564	3.927	How 'bout, aah, is some more red pieces, or, here's some more		
38	48	302.478	303.402	0.924		it's ###	
38	48	303.831	306.207	2.376	Well this looks like the same kind of plant		
38	48	308.517	310.431	1.914		We can't do this puzzle	
38	48	311.058	314.358	3.3	Well, do you wanna s- try putting something else together, maybe the leopard?		
38	48	315.48	316.272	0.792	Mmkay		
38	48	317.262	321.585	4.323	Let's put that little froggy to the side, and put this on the side		
38	48	321.057	324.423	3.366		*noises*	
38	48	323.334	324.72	1.386	Whoa, is that the leopard?		
38	48	324.885	325.512	0.627		Yes	
38	48	325.479	330.33	4.851	No, that's a- Oh, that's his nose *laughing* Huh, okay. Is this his nose too?		
38	48	331.386	332.178	0.792		Mm-hmm	
38	48	331.518	332.64	1.122	Maybe, his freckles		
38	48	333.399	336.798	3.399	on his nose, Oh good. What else?		
38	48	338.58	340.263	1.683		This is his body	
38	48	338.58	341.286	2.706	### That's his body?

38	48	385.011	386.727	1.716	What's between your nose and your forehead?		
38	48	387.651	390.687	3.036	Look at me. What's between my nose and my forehead?		
38	48	392.535	393.756	1.221		Eye	
38	48	393.129	399.861	6.732	Eyes. He has green eyes. *laughing* Does that go there? Or maybe, I don't know, here's another one

38	48	434.676	435.732	1.056	Pay attention		
38	48	436.953	439.989	3.036	Okay good, now what else has the spots?		
38	48	442.233	444.906	2.673	Mmkay, let's see if we can figure it out that one		
38	48	447.348	453.321	5.973	Good job. Alright, so we're making so progress here. Umm... What about this blue area?

38	48	594.33	597.63	3.3	So, see how these blue pieces might connect all together		
38	48	600.237	602.184	1.947	You don't see? You want me to do it?

38	24	1357.851	1361.613	3.762		Now we gotta find the octopus arms	
38	24	1362.273	1364.814	2.541	Well, I think you've pretty much got his arms		
38	24	1365.144	1367.157	2.013		Those are his legs	
38	24	1366.959	1370.556	3.597	*laughing* Oh, I see, those are his legs so these are his arms. How many?

39	24	142.56	145.101	2.541	'Cause the end piece ### have the little straight back		
39	24	149.094	151.173	2.079	Yeah, that goes somewhere, we have to figure it out		
39	24	151.635	155.43	3.795		It goes right there-

39	24	222.519	223.938	1.419	I think this goes here		
39	24	224.598	226.248	1.65		And I think this-

45	48	683.034	689.799	6.765	I think we're coming- I think it's next weekend, and you're gonna be a little bit closer to five, but still not five quite yet		
45	48	694.518	702.504	7.986		Like two, two day- two days and one, and like three weeks? Or something?	
45	48	703.131	707.454	4.323	Yeah, I think Poppa said yesterday that you're three days and two weeks away		
45	48	708.741	711.546	2.805	Maybe now you're only two days and two weeks away from being-		
45	48	714.087	715.275	1.188	So where do you wanna start?		
45	48	717.288	719.169	1.881	You said you wanted to start with the toucan?		
45	48	719.697	721.611	1.914		Yeah	
45	48	720.621	722.568	1.947	Should we try to find pieces of him?		
45	48	722.865	725.901	3.036		*noises*	
45	48	726.462	731.082	4.62		Like, I think some pieces of him- Here are the butterflies	
45	48	731.412	732.732	1.32	You wanna start with that?		
45	48	733.095	733.887	0.792		Yeah	
45	48	735.9	738.342	2.442		### somewhere here, yeah	
45	48	739.893	742.17	2.277	Where- What else are some butterfly pieces?		
45	48	742.368	743.853	1.485		There and there	
45	48	742.698	743.556	0.858	That one, okay		
45	48	743.952	744.447	0.495	Yep		
45	48	745.074	745.8	0.726		And there	
45	48	745.8	746.394	0.594	Okay		
45	48	746.658	747.318	0.66		And there	
45	48	747.483	750.783	3.3	All the blue- That's a very- it's easy to see the blue isn't it?		
45	48	750.684	751.377	0.693		And here	
45	48	751.245	752.862	1.617	Oh, another one. Yep, good		
45	48	753.522	756.096	2.574		That's a lot of butterfly pieces	
45	48	755.7	756.624	0.924	it is		
45	48	756.855	759.99	3.135		It's 'cause they're small, so, that does not go there	
45	48	759.792	761.871	2.079	Oh good corner		
45	48	759.957	760.848	0.891			
45	48	762.432	764.907	2.475	It makes things easier when you find a corner piece		
45	48	765.501	767.613	2.112		Yeah so we ### along the edges	
45	48	765.93	766.854	0.924			
45	48	766.887	767.118	0.231			
45	48	767.646	768.504	0.858	Yeah		
45	48	768.405	772.068	3.663		*noises*	
45	48	769.362	770.286	0.924			
45	48	772.563	779.691	7.128		*noises*	
45	48	780.615	781.671	1.056		Does this go here?	
45	48	782.166	784.509	2.343	I think it does. It's aah, just a little bit-		
45	48	782.265	783.255	0.99			
45	48	785.532	786.885	1.353		###	
45	48	786.258	788.931	2.673	It's a little bit stuck, I think. Yeah, there		
45	48	789.921	795.069	5.148		Alright now here, It's one big butterfly	
45	48	792.033	792.924	0.891			
45	48	796.158	797.61	1.452		Big butterfly	
45	48	796.95	797.973	1.023	Yes it is		
45	48	798.963	799.689	0.726		Very...	
45	48	801.372	803.055	1.683		Unusual *laughing*	
45	48	801.669	802.428	0.759			
45	48	805.068	805.959	0.891	What's that?		
45	48	806.85	807.741	0.891			
45	48	807.411	809.127	1.716		The tiger's mouth	
45	48	809.226	810.216	0.99	*laughing*		
45	48	811.305	814.605	3.3		They have mouths like that, and so do lions	
45	48	814.341	815.067	0.726	###		
45	48	815.199	821.106	5.907		They have big noses, they have really good sense. Really big, and really good senses	
45	48	822.327	825.066	2.739		Some big animals don't have good senses ###	
45	48	828.795	830.544	1.749		### Come on	
45	48	831.963	833.514	1.551	Good, that looks like the whole butterfly		
45	48	832.161	833.019	0.858			
45	48	836.088	838.695	2.607		Sure is. Yep, sure is	
45	48	841.269	843.447	2.178	Should we keep working on the tiger since-		
45	48	843.216	843.81	0.594		Yeah	
45	48	844.008	844.965	0.957	Or the leopard?		
45	48	844.107	845.526	1.419		###	
45	48	847.638	848.595	0.957	That looks- Yep		
45	48	849.618	851.301	1.683	Want me to help you collect the pieces?		
45	48	849.948	850.377	0.429		###	
45	48	856.35	858.231	1.881		Oh that's some kind of sna-	
45	48	857.835	859.716	1.881	I'm gonna give you ones with spots		
45	48	860.574	861.927	1.353		Okay	
45	48	868.263	870.111	1.848		I can't figure this-	
45	48	870.243	872.091	1.848	Hmm, it looks like part of an eye		
45	48	872.289	872.949	0.66		Yeah	
45	48	873.972	876.942	2.97		Like somehow here?	
45	48	876.183	877.239	1.056	That might be the other eye?		
45	48	878.097	878.856	0.759	Do you think?		
45	48	880.341	882.288	1.947	### 'Cause he's gonna have two eyes, I think		
45	48	885.093	886.743	1.65		These are ###	
45	48	886.875	887.172	0.297			
45	48	888.063	888.954	0.891	That's good		
45	48	891.132	891.99	0.858		###	
45	48	891.396	892.782	1.386			
45	48	892.584	893.31	0.726	Good		
45	48	893.838	895.554	1.716		Now he looks serious	
45	48	895.587	896.676	1.089	*laughing* He does		
45	48	897.336	900.24	2.904		Is it a tiger or not a tiger?	
45	48	899.745	903.012	3.267	I think it's a leopard, when they have spots like that, I think that's a leopard		
45	48	899.811	900.603	0.792			
45	48	901.989	905.289	3.3		A leopard. Are those leopards fast?	
45	48	905.256	905.85	0.594	Yes		
45	48	906.345	911.79	5.445		Leopards are fast, yeah. They have big strong legs, too ###	
45	48	912.879	914.76	1.881		###	
45	48	915.717	917.829	2.112		That go here? Think	
45	48	918.819	920.535	1.716		Does-	
45	48	920.634	921.888	1.254	Mmm, I don't know		
45	48	922.02	923.109	1.089		###	
45	48	926.31	930.567	4.257	We still need to finish the top of his head. Oh that's good, that's the side of his head		
45	48	927.63	928.455	0.825			
45	48	932.085	933.867	1.782		Top of his head	
45	48	934.725	935.649	0.924			
45	48	935.55	936.408	0.858	That's good		
45	48	937.101	939.312	2.211		Now there's that swinging	
45	48	939.147	939.873	0.726	Mm-hmm		
45	48	940.467	942.051	1.584		###	
45	48	943.635	945.384	1.749		*noises*	
45	48	946.143	953.964	7.821	You know what's funny, I see? Those look like the little aah, feet of a frog, maybe? Or a- some other creature		
45	48	947.694	948.123	0.429		Hmm	
45	48	954.129	956.604	2.475		A snail ###	
45	48	958.65	960.168	1.518	Maybe we should look for more of those		
45	48	961.356	962.181	0.825		Mmm	
45	48	966.405	968.22	1.815		Don't see-	
45	48	968.814	970.332	1.518	Or do you wanna try another corner?		
45	48	970.464	978.681	8.217		Umm, try another corner. There are three more corners and aah, three more edges	
45	48	979.011	980.562	1.551	Can you find a corner piece?		
45	48	980.232	988.647	8.415		No we have one more edge, we have one more edge! 'Cause we already started on this, and this, but not this	
45	48	986.04	986.7	0.66	Mm-hmm		
45	48	988.779	989.373	0.594	###		
45	48	992.838	995.379	2.541		*noises*	
45	48	999.339	1001.121	1.782		###	
45	48	1004.85	1011.912	7.062	There's a lot of green here. We might want to choose a strategy. Either do corners, do edges-		
45	48	1014.816	1019.502	4.686	Try to finish up the mushrooms here, maybe? You see these mushrooms?		
45	48	1017.852	1019.205	1.353		Mmm, yeah	
45	48	1020.921	1024.551	3.63		I found more ### *noises*	
45	48	1024.254	1025.871	1.617	Oh, more hands? Yeah		
45	48	1026.465	1029.468	3.003		More hands to some kind of-	
45	48	1028.016	1029.039	1.023			
45	48	1028.973	1029.864	0.891	Well that's good		
45	48	1030.26	1032.834	2.574		###	
45	48	1033.296	1036.959	3.663	I think that might be a frog. Do you see any more pieces that look like that?		
45	48	1035.144	1035.969	0.825		Frog	
45	48	1037.388	1038.18	0.792		No	
45	48	1038.906	1041.546	2.64		Surprisingly not- Oh here	
45	48	1043.46	1045.836	2.376		Is some frog	
45	48	1047.024	1048.443	1.419		This must go-	
45	48	1049.928	1052.337	2.409	I can't see that whole piece. What kind of piece is that?		
45	48	1052.403	1053.03	0.627		A corner!	
45	48	1053.129	1053.822	0.693	Yeah		
45	48	1053.657	1054.482	0.825		It must go up-	
45	48	1055.373	1056.297	0.924	That's a good guess		
45	48	1057.947	1058.376	0.429		Or	
45	48	1060.818	1064.58	3.762	Mmm then- I think the one you chose was good because otherwise he'll be upside-down		
45	48	1067.319	1069.002	1.683		And this wouldn't work	
45	48	1069.068	1070.982	1.914	That's right. That wouldn't work		
45	48	1070.19	1070.718	0.528		So	
45	48	1073.028	1073.787	0.759			
45	48	1075.305	1077.087	1.782	Do you see any other froggy pieces?		
45	48	1077.351	1078.638	1.287		Mmm	
45	48	1080.156	1081.476	1.32		More tentacle things	
45	48	1083.126	1085.568	2.442		###	
45	48	1084.71	1086.459	1.749	I don't think that's the same-		
45	48	1087.482	1090.122	2.64		Yeah, those have big dots	
45	48	1090.254	1090.881	0.627	Right		
45	48	1091.211	1093.026	1.815		Those are some kind of snail	
45	48	1094.049	1094.808	0.759		###	
45	48	1097.349	1098.075	0.726		Aah	
45	48	1100.451	1103.949	3.498	What about these, are those frog pieces?		
45	48	1101.87	1102.596	0.726		Okay	
45	48	1104.147	1104.873	0.726			
45	48	1105.863	1106.688	0.825		Yeah	
45	48	1106.754	1107.645	0.891			
45	48	1107.711	1108.338	0.627	Good		
45	48	1109.064	1111.77	2.706		Now I need a ### here	
45	48	1115.829	1121.076	5.247		We're done with the ### *noises*	
45	48	1122.231	1126.917	4.686	You know what we started to- we started to do I think over here? Do you see this?		
45	48	1125.432	1125.993	0.561		Mm-hmm	
45	48	1126.851	1127.115	0.264			
45	48	1127.94	1128.996	1.056	Pretty red		
45	48	1129.227	1129.986	0.759		Mm-hmm	
45	48	1130.085	1133.088	3.003	Do you think we could find more ### pieces?		
45	48	1131.603	1133.946	2.343		Ant, red ants ###	
45	48	1133.781	1140.018	6.237	Those- Do you see- I feel like that's a little bit of a different color red. This is more of a bright red- Yes		
45	48	1138.599	1139.589	0.99		Pinky-red	
45	48	1140.678	1144.374	3.696	And I wonder if some of these go in that area		
45	48	1150.446	1152.129	1.683	That's good, you're looking for an edge		
45	48	1152.954	1154.472	1.518	Maybe it goes somewhere along the top?		
45	48	1156.848	1157.739	0.891			
45	48	1157.64	1158.267	0.627	Good		
45	48	1162.392	1165.923	3.531		Alright, this... not a edge	
45	48	1167.309	1168.794	1.485		### goes along here	
45	48	1169.157	1169.817	0.66		No	
45	48	1170.642	1172.16	1.518	It's not an edge? Oh, okay		
45	48	1176.219	1177.407	1.188		Here's the-	
45	48	1178.397	1179.816	1.419	Here's one that might be an edge		
45	48	1181.202	1182.06	0.858		Yes	
45	48	1181.334	1183.083	1.749	Oh and you found another edge, that's good		
45	48	1184.073	1186.383	2.31		This is littler ###	
45	48	1187.604	1189.056	1.452		### go here	
45	48	1191.069	1195.128	4.059	Aah, I don't think that quite fits. Do you see how there's that other color there?		
45	48	1196.085	1198.098	2.013	Try this- Try this over here		
45	48	1199.352	1200.078	0.726		###	
45	48	1201.761	1202.553	0.792		Alright

45	48	1206.513	1207.338	0.825			
45	48	1210.077	1212.354	2.277		Someone poured some red	
45	48	1212.453	1213.245	0.792	Yeah		
45	48	1214.169	1216.413	2.244	Do you see any more of that bright pinky-red?		
45	48	1218.294	1218.855	0.561		Here	
45	48	1218.822	1219.548	0.726	Yeah		
45	48	1220.472	1223.574	3.102		So, no it doesn't go there	
45	48	1229.085	1229.91	0.825			
45	48	1229.613	1230.438	0.825	That's good		
45	48	1231.065	1232.286	1.221		It goes there ###

50	48	5.841	6.072	0.231			48 Piece - Start
50	48	6.27	7.755	1.485	Alright, how do we do this first?		
50	48	7.656	9.273	1.617		You have to get it out	
50	48	9.306	10.098	0.792	How do we get it out?		
50	48	11.088	11.484	0.396			Researcher Out
50	48	11.418	12.771	1.353		You just flip it over	
50	48	13.035	14.355	1.32	Mmkay, let's do that		
50	48	17.622	18.513	0.891		I told you	
50	48	18.579	20.592	2.013	Yep. Alright, we gonna mix 'em up?		
50	48	23.727	25.806	2.079		This one's a tricky- Whoa!	
50	48	25.08	26.367	1.287	It looks tricky		
50	48	26.829	30.294	3.465		### where this goes ###	
50	48	29.964	34.056	4.092	Looks new, too, 'cause their ones at the library would just come apart real easily, right?		
50	48	37.587	40.788	3.201		But this one's hard, ###	
50	48	41.151	42.834	1.683	Mmkay. Now what do we do first?		
50	48	43.23	44.55	1.32		I want this one	
50	48	45.111	46.728	1.617	Okay, that's a middle piece, right?		
50	48	47.157	47.85	0.693		So-	
50	48	47.388	48.84	1.452	So, what should we do first?		
50	48	50.193	51.744	1.551		We should do this one	
50	48	52.569	53.79	1.221		We should do this one	
50	48	53.691	59.367	5.676	How 'bout we try to find the corners first? That's a good one, that's an edge. and then we'll do edges next		
50	48	56.331	56.958	0.627		###	
50	48	58.773	59.829	1.056		It goes here	
50	48	59.829	62.634	2.805	Does it? I don't remember where it goes, but let's get the corners		
50	48	62.238	63.261	1.023		Aah, here	
50	48	64.713	67.089	2.376	Well, this has a flat side, right?		
50	48	65.868	66.132	0.264			
50	48	67.287	68.673	1.386		So it goes on the bottom?	
50	48	69.201	73.656	4.455	It goes somewhere along the edge. So let's find the corners, can we find the corners?		
50	48	72.501	72.996	0.495		*gasp*	
50	48	77.55	78.408	0.858		Mmm	
50	48	78.705	80.52	1.815	Do you see any corner- Is that a corner piece?		
50	48	85.107	86.427	1.32	Do those go together that way?		
50	48	87.153	89.958	2.805	I don't think that that matches. Do you think that matches?		
50	48	93.489	96.591	3.102	Well that's not a corner. But I think you're right that they go together		
50	48	97.449	100.419	2.97		But this one goes together with that one	
50	48	101.508	103.521	2.013	Is that an edge piece? Oh good job		
50	48	104.28	106.623	2.343		Goes on botto- It goes like that	
50	48	105.468	107.382	1.914	so we have to figure out which way is up		
50	48	110.22	111.474	1.254		This one's up	
50	48	111.078	115.335	4.257	Okay, let's find the corners. Do you see any other corners? There should be four corners, right?		
50	48	115.698	116.886	1.188	Oh that's a good edge		
50	48	118.602	119.757	1.155	Ooh, nice!

50	48	134.541	136.158	1.617	Nice. Is it sticky?		
50	48	136.62	137.346	0.726	There it goes		
50	48	139.029	140.613	1.584		Where does this go?	
50	48	140.613	146.652	6.039	I don't know. He's a middle piece though, so why don't we get the edges and the corners first, and then we'll try to figure out which way this goes		
50	48	141.933	142.527	0.594		###	
50	48	146.454	147.081	0.627		Ooh

50	48	164.703	165.825	1.122	I don't see any more corners		
50	48	165.924	168.333	2.409		Oh! This one doesn't have an edge	
50	48	168.399	170.313	1.914	That one doesn't have an edge. This one has an edge		
50	48	170.247	171.765	1.518		Oh yeah. where does this go?	
50	48	171.534	172.623	1.089	I don't know

50	48	180.279	181.533	1.254	Does it go over here?		
50	48	182.094	183.084	0.99		I think it goes-	
50	48	182.523	183.48	0.957	Did you try it?		
50	48	184.008	184.899	0.891		I think it goes here	
50	48	185.889	186.153	0.264			
50	48	186.78	187.77	0.99	Oh good job		
50	48	188.628	189.948	1.32		It goes on bottom!	
50	48	190.113	192.654	2.541	Nice. I think this is part of the toucan		
50	48	190.641	191.433	0.792		### does that

50	48	198.033	199.782	1.749		We didn't mix that up	
50	48	200.673	207.537	6.864	Let's look for the corners. We need three more corners. 'Member a corner piece, it has this edge on two sides		
50	48	209.022	209.781	0.759	Do you see any?		
50	48	210.408	211.167	0.759		*gasp*

50	48	213.873	215.292	1.419	We'll have to figure out where it goes		
50	48	215.952	216.975	1.023	Do you think it goes over there?		
50	48	216.414	217.14	0.726			
50	48	217.569	218.328	0.759		I think so	
50	48	218.13	220.605	2.475	Okay. What about other corner pieces?

50	48	280.599	281.457	0.858	Does it go on the bottom?		
50	48	287.859	289.806	1.947	Hmm, is this an edge?

50	48	591.03	595.452	4.422	That's an inside piece, so we'll have to wait and see. That might go like around here somewhere		
50	48	596.046	597.531	1.485		*gasp* I know where that goes	
50	48	597.366	599.313	1.947	This doesn't have an edge though, right?		
50	48	599.643	600.468	0.825	Does it have a edge?

51	24	26.598	28.017	1.419		Mommy do it with me	
51	24	27.951	29.007	1.056	So look at the picture		
51	24	30.558	34.056	3.498	And so the shark is in the corner, and is that the jellyfish?		
51	24	34.089	34.65	0.561		Uh-huh

51	24	51.843	57.519	5.676	Let's to the puzzle. We can do it- I don't think we need to do it on here. We can just do it on here. That way we can look at this as a guide, okay?		
51	24	58.674	60.753	2.079		I think it's gonna get covered up	
51	24	59.895	60.126	0.231			
51	24	61.05	62.535	1.485	No, we're ### on the table

51	24	86.295	87.252	0.957		Mmm	
51	24	86.361	87.879	1.518	I think that's up at the top, right?		
51	24	88.968	92.598	3.63	See the straight edge? So that's gonna go up at the top. Does that connect right there?		
51	24	97.911	98.538	0.627	Mmkay		
51	24	102.399	103.587	1.188	### the others		
51	24	112.761	113.454	0.693	Good		
51	24	120.648	124.575	3.927	You can probably try to find the seahorse body. That'd probably be easy		
51	24	128.337	128.832	0.495		###	
51	24	128.931	129.789	0.858	Mm-hmm

51	24	140.382	142.263	1.881	Or you can see what else might go with that purple piece		
51	24	144.177	145.101	0.924	That doesn't go there		
51	24	157.344	158.829	1.485	What color is the face, do you think?		
51	24	161.799	162.789	0.99	Oh that's good		
51	24	166.98	168.993	2.013		I don't think this is a type of animal	
51	24	169.554	170.445	0.891	That's not an animal		
51	24	171.105	173.184	2.079	What color face do you think that has?		
51	24	173.448	174.471	1.023		I don't know	
51	24	175.23	176.154	0.924	Blue?		
51	24	176.715	178.2	1.485	Look at the umm, example		
51	24	178.86	180.378	1.518		Yeah	
51	24	179.85	180.147	0.297			
51	24	179.916	181.467	1.551	So you have to find a blue piece		
51	24	186.45	187.803	1.353		This is too small	
51	24	187.869	188.694	0.825	Mm-hmm		
51	24	190.179	196.086	5.907	But look, see how this edge is straight? ### Straight end- straight edge for there. But you can see if it fits up here somewhere		
51	24	192.258	192.984	0.726		Mm-hmm	
51	24	197.538	199.485	1.947		*noises*	
51	24	202.059	202.686	0.627	Good		
51	24	211.53	214.632	3.102		Mmm, mom I can't find what goes there	
51	24	215.094	216.018	0.924	###		
51	24	220.11	221.727	1.617	You need something that has a straight edge		
51	24	227.205	230.934	3.729	You wanna try to connect the orange? Maybe put the orange parts together		
51	24	237.963	238.788	0.825	That's good		
51	24	243.111	245.091	1.98		The bottom of the shark	
51	24	246.015	251.361	5.346	Is it? Or it looks like an octopus. Or is that the shark? What is that? I don't know what that is		
51	24	251.724	253.605	1.881	*yeah, don't put that on your head, silly girl*		
51	24	255.981	256.839	0.858	Let's see		
51	24	264.132	267.729	3.597	Hmm, I see this eye Look. Does that go there?		
51	24	272.811	273.702	0.891		Mmm	
51	24	273.801	274.725	0.924	Mm-hmm		
51	24	286.506	288.453	1.947	Good. That's a shark		
51	24	299.871	300.135	0.264			
51	24	302.709	303.798	1.089		What's that go in?	
51	24	304.524	306.504	1.98	Mmm, I don't think that goes there		
51	24	309.045	310.035	0.99		The ###	
51	24	309.738	311.685	1.947	Mm-hmm, where do you think this big orange piece goes?		
51	24	312.246	312.873	0.627		Mmm	
51	24	316.008	319.044	3.036	Aah, that looks good. What is that, octopus		
51	24	319.902	320.727	0.825	Or a squid		
51	24	321.057	322.113	1.056		That's the squid	
51	24	321.387	322.509	1.122	What is that, a squid?		
51	24	324.423	326.601	2.178		I don't think we have a octopus	
51	24	326.337	328.944	2.607	Actually, I think it is an octopus, 'cause it has eight legs		
51	24	330.594	331.221	0.627	Yeah		
51	24	352.605	354.717	2.112		How do you know we can do it on the table?	
51	24	355.575	360.525	4.95	Umm, because you can do puzzles on the table. And I wanted us to see the example, it makes it easier		
51	24	378.345	380.127	1.782		This doesn't look right	
51	24	379.632	380.457	0.825	Mm-mm		
51	24	381.975	383.262	1.287		What goes here?	
51	24	383.163	384.78	1.617	Oh, this might be the other piece, sorry		
51	24	392.931	393.591	0.66	Good		
51	24	400.653	401.247	0.594	Good

51	48	653.796	657.921	4.125	Yeah, so, you match it up. Turn it around, the straight edges go together		
51	48	660.594	661.188	0.594	See?		
51	48	663.366	664.587	1.221	That looks like an eye		
51	48	665.313	666.798	1.485		This is not a straight edge	
51	48	666.798	667.26	0.462	No

51	48	696.366	699.666	3.3	We're missing part of the baby jaguar. Or the jaguar- here		
51	48	699.6	701.382	1.782		Or the big jaguar	
51	48	700.359	702.207	1.848	This looks like it. You see the mushrooms?		
51	48	702.669	703.329	0.66		Mm-hmm	
51	48	703.065	704.814	1.749	And then part of his mouth there?		
51	48	706.563	708.576	2.013	And then what's next, these mushrooms		
51	48	709.929	710.985	1.056		Yes	
51	48	711.216	714.285	3.069	And so, maybe try to find some more mushrooms and ants?

51	48	746.922	749.595	2.673		Mommy, I don't know what ### goes here	
51	48	749.661	750.519	0.858	You see the green?		
51	48	750.552	751.179	0.627		Mmm	
51	48	751.08	754.644	3.564	Do you think, maybe it connects to this green right here, and that part of the mushroom

51	48	792.759	793.386	0.627	No		
51	48	796.092	798.6	2.508		This puzzle is too tricky!	
51	48	798.666	800.316	1.65	It's a little bit tricky, but you can do it		
51	48	801.141	803.121	1.98		'Cause I completed the butterfly	
51	48	803.187	805.2	2.013	Mm-hmm. And you did that really quickly		
51	48	814.11	814.803	0.693	###

51	48	833.085	835.857	2.772	You wanna try to connect the ants? And see if that connects there?

51	48	841.5	842.259	0.759		This	
51	48	842.754	846.681	3.927	Yeah, but that's at the bottom, so that probably won't fit, but there's some more red plants though, right?		
51	48	847.374	848.661	1.287		###	
51	48	849.948	851.301	1.353		Mommy, what's this?

52	48	278.15	281.55	3.4	*laughing* How about we try it this way?		
52	48	282.32	284.61	2.29	Where would, where do you think it should fit?		
52	48	285.955	286.345	0.39	No.		
52	48	287.9	289.38	1.48	How about we try it-		
52	48	289.44	293.27	3.83		*singing*	
52	48	290.4	293.06	2.66	That doesn't fit there, does it?		
52	48	293.48	294.65	1.17	No, don't force it in.		
52	48	296.435	298.235	1.8	Try this one like this.		
52	48	299.835	301.195	1.36	Where do you think it might go?		
52	48	303.975	305.105	1.13	Tur- turn it around.		
52	48	305.95	307.19	1.24	No, that's not the same colors.		
52	48	306.87	308.79	1.92		Aah, I can't do it!	
52	48	308.92	310.87	1.95	Do you want me to put it down?		
52	48	310.915	311.155	0.24		Yeah	
52	48	311.185	312.615	1.43	Stop spinning on the chair before you fall.		
52	48	312.68	313.89	1.21	How about right there?		
52	48	314.015	315.915	1.9	Does that look like a good place for it?		
52	48	318.295	318.975	0.68	Yes it does.		
52	48	319.045	320.485	1.44		Yes it does!	
52	48	320.525	321.095	0.57	*laughing*		
52	48	321.4	326.44	5.04		*singing*	
52	48	326.57	327.25	0.68	Turn it.		
52	48	329.72	330.17	0.45	Nope.		
52	48	330.175	331.595	1.42	Don't force it together.		
52	48	331.855	333.225	1.37	How about try to put these together.		
52	48	333.32	335.65	2.33		How about I can do the butterfly?	
52	48	335.685	336.735	1.05	Okay, do the butterfly.		
52	48	336.96	339.27	2.31	Get all the pieces that look like it could be the butterfly.		
52	48	340.455	341.065	0.61	This one.		
52	48	341.45	342.6	1.15		The butterfly like that?	
52	48	341.705	341.995	0.29	This one.		
52	48	342.94	344.21	1.27		Mama, what's that?	
52	48	343.1	343.58	0.48	This one.		
52	48	344.805	346.305	1.5	It's part of the butterfly's body.		
52	48	346.595	348.915	2.32		Why the butterfly needs a body?	
52	48	347.255	348.295	1.04	Let's put those together.		
52	48	349.585	350.845	1.26	Let's put those together.		
52	48	351.115	352.135	1.02	Does that go there?		
52	48	352.215	352.635	0.42		Aah.	
52	48	352.655	354.525	1.87	No.  That's not the same picture.		
52	48	355.36	357.41	2.05	Try it someplace else.		
52	48	357.445	358.715	1.27		But I can't do it!	
52	48	358.79	360.57	1.78	I think you can do it.		
52	48	361.07	362.36	1.29	Try it here.		
52	48	362.435	363.135	0.7		Okay.	
52	48	363.155	364.585	1.43	Does that look like it could go there?		
52	48	364.94	365.42	0.48	No.		
52	48	365.72	366.73	1.01	Not that one.		
52	48	366.785	368.445	1.66		No, not this one!	
52	48	368.675	372.065	3.39	Stop raising your voice and sit in the chair like a big girl.		
52	48	374.46	376.73	2.27	You can't, that doesn't go together.		
52	48	377.165	378.915	1.75	Try this one on there.		
52	48	379.36	380.92	1.56	Try this one on there.		
52	48	383.62	384.44	0.82	Other way.

52	48	386.81	389.44	2.63		No!  I can't do it.	
52	48	389.905	391.465	1.56	How about something like that?		
52	48	389.925	393.885	3.96		*singing*	
52	48	393.035	394.195	1.16	How about something like that?		
52	48	394.225	395.675	1.45		"A ""catrishion."""	
52	48	395.7	396.51	0.81	What is it?		
52	48	396.535	399.525	2.99	Catrishion. What is that?  Is that a word? *Laughing*		
52	48	397.2	397.89	0.69		I got!	
52	48	399.535	399.925	0.39		No.	
52	48	399.92	402.23	2.31	Are you making up words?		
52	48	402.28	409.83	7.55		A catrishion.  It's a scientist and catrishion for your bowl to eat food.	
52	48	409.855	411.375	1.52	Really? How about that goes there.		
52	48	411.415	412.745	1.33		It's a catrishion.	
52	48	412.965	415.225	2.26	Hmm, i'm not familiar with that word.		
52	48	413.24	414.68	1.44		and a ###	
52	48	415.24	419.94	4.7		Ma, did ###, it's a catrishion.	
52	48	416.195	417.505	1.31	Catrishion.		
52	48	419.99	420.8	0.81	Constriction?		
52	48	420.835	422.205	1.37		No, its a catrishion.	
52	48	422.41	423.97	1.56	Why'd you put that there?		
52	48	424.09	426.95	2.86		An elephant is a catrishion.	
52	48	426.98	427.67	0.69	Mm-hmm.		
52	48	427.765	436.735	8.97		Don't put it in here.  Its the part of th- it's the part, that's th- mom that's the part of the, the butterfly's body.	
52	48	431.61	433.27	1.66	Yeah, it goes down there.		
52	48	436.75	437.61	0.86	Mm-hmm.		
52	48	437.66	438.66	1.0	I think so.		
52	48	439.36	442.77	3.41	Turn it.  You have to turn it until it fits.		
52	48	442.965	444.135	1.17	It's upside-down.  Turn it.		
52	48	444.21	445.4	1.19	There, now put it in there.		
52	48	446.445	446.805	0.36	Nope.		
52	48	447.565	450.955	3.39	That one.  Put it in that one.  Pick it up.  Put it down.		
52	48	452.21	456.41	4.2		*singing*	
52	48	454.4	455.6	1.2	Push it down.		
52	48	456.65	458.57	1.92	There you go, see?  That worked out great!		
52	48	460.95	462.57	1.62	Where does that one go?		
52	48	463.88	464.47	0.59	No, turn it.		
52	48	465.085	465.745	0.66	Turn it.		
52	48	467.105	467.775	0.67	Okay turn it again.		
52	48	468.37	469.91	1.54	There. Now put it in there.		
52	48	470.06	471.54	1.48	Nope, not quite.		
52	48	471.7	472.56	0.86	That doesn't go there.		
52	48	473.02	474.53	1.51	It doesn't fit the picture.		
52	48	474.555	478.285	3.73	It has to make a picture when you put it back together. We have to put the picture back together.		
52	48	478.3	478.61	0.31		No.	
52	48	478.765	480.495	1.73	I think we can do that, right?		
52	48	480.98	483.99	3.01	Let's see where this one goes.  That goes in there.		
52	48	484.01	485.24	1.23	Is that a good idea?		
52	48	486.515	489.165	2.65	Nope.  Maybe that one goes up there, what do you think?		
52	48	489.2	491.15	1.95		Mmm.  No, wait wait wait!	
52	48	491.295	492.975	1.68	You wait wait wait!		
52	48	493.755	494.745	0.99		Oh wait.	
52	48	494.78	496.42	1.64	That's not the way.		
52	48	496.47	496.88	0.41		No.	
52	48	497.095	497.975	0.88	No, turn it.		
52	48	497.325	497.665	0.34		Thats-	
52	48	498.415	499.045	0.63	Turn it.		
52	48	499.94	501.22	1.28	Okay. *laughing*		
52	48	502.36	504.31	1.95	You turned it all the way.		
52	48	504.695	505.685	0.99	Try that one here.		
52	48	505.75	506.9	1.15	Try that one right here.		
52	48	507.175	507.565	0.39	Right here.		
52	48	509.75	510.54	0.79	Does it fit?		
52	48	511.695	512.215	0.52	Yes.		
52	48	512.575	513.005	0.43	Perfect.		
52	48	513.94	514.34	0.4	Alright.		
52	48	514.65	516.26	1.61	Was it perfect?  It fit in there?		
52	48	516.355	516.785	0.43		Yes.	
52	48	517.23	518.23	1.0	Okay let's try that one up here.		
52	48	522.87	524.07	1.2	Does it fit?		
52	48	524.77	525.5	0.73	Perfect.		
52	48	526.005	526.845	0.84	Good job.		
52	48	526.885	528.165	1.28	Now let's put the little leopard back together.		
52	48	528.965	530.075	1.11	This is all his spots.		
52	48	532.06	533.9	1.84		This is all his spots.	
52	48	534.03	535.79	1.76	Yeah.  We've got to fit him together.		
52	48	535.87	536.99	1.12	How does he go?		
52	48	537.04	538.35	1.31	Maybe that one goes right here.		
52	48	538.955	540.105	1.15	Now turn it.		
52	48	540.76	541.3	0.54	Turn it.		
52	48	541.67	542.28	0.61	Now, stop.		
52	48	542.935	544.295	1.36	Stop right there.		
52	48	544.775	545.335	0.56	And put it- no.		
52	48	545.465	548.185	2.72	I didn't say turn it.  I said stop right there.		
52	48	548.285	549.125	0.84	And put it down.		
52	48	549.215	549.995	0.78	*laughing*		
52	48	550.055	550.955	0.9		*laughing*

52	48	553.46	554.1	0.64	*laughing*		
52	48	554.15	555.26	1.11	Does that work?		
52	48	555.285	557.525	2.24	Wait wait wait wait wait.		
52	48	557.525	559.375	1.85		Mom, why are you laughing?	
52	48	559.4	560.98	1.58	'Cause you're laughing, that's why.		
52	48	561.94	562.91	0.97	Does that go there?		
52	48	561.965	565.665	3.7		Why are you laughing? Mom why are you laughing in the room?	
52	48	564.065	564.565	0.5	*laughing*		
52	48	566.245	569.685	3.44	Okay, this goes over here.		
52	48	572.045	575.015	2.97		Mom, it's a beautiful butterfly.

52	48	601.285	608.175	6.89		*singing*	
52	48	605.32	608.37	3.05	What am I doing? Let's put that over on the side.		
52	48	608.49	616.54	8.05		*singing*	
52	48	616.255	618.125	1.87	That's not ants, that's flowers.		
52	48	618.19	620.59	2.4	Put this together so we can put it down.		
52	48	621.95	622.92	0.97	How does this go together?		
52	48	622.675	624.385	1.71		That's ants' flowers?	
52	48	624.37	626.24	1.87	That's fl-a flower.		
52	48	626.375	628.115	1.74	How does it go together?		
52	48	630.395	633.205	2.81		Close your eyes and look and see.	
52	48	633.42	635.04	1.62		Mom, close your eyes!	
52	48	635.0	637.64	2.64	No, we're putting the puzzle together now.		
52	48	636.66	641.16	4.5		Now you have to close your eyes and stop making puzzles.	
52	48	641.19	643.32	2.13	No, i'm not done.  I want to finish.		
52	48	643.995	645.915	1.92	How about that?

52	48	685.915	688.505	2.59	I'm not sure that he's standing on anything.		
52	48	688.59	690.49	1.9	Is he on the flower?		
52	48	688.6	689.33	0.73		He's standi-

52	48	705.025	706.435	1.41	Is that good?		
52	48	709.52	710.7	1.18	Did I do a good job?		
52	48	710.72	711.38	0.66		Yes.

53	24	413.777	417.527	3.75	do you think it moved on the top? Corner pieces have to be in the corner. I don't think they be in the middle		
53	24	419.037	421.207	2.17	You can use the top corner or the bottom corner

53	24	485.207	487.287	2.08		Maybe because, 'cause of the colors!

53	24	489.012	489.292	0.28		yeah

53	24	528.089	530.509	2.42		I think it could go this way

53	48	890.015	895.025	5.01	So do you think this is a corner that goes here in the middle of the puzzle or should we flip it somewhere maybe it'll fit somewhere else		
53	48	895.705	897.065	1.36		Maybe it goes over here	
53	48	897.51	898.17	0.66		or here	
53	48	898.455	902.145	3.69	but then the flat edge. Remember? It's if it's a corner piece it has to go on one of these corners

56	24	40.905	42.025	1.12	I think that's a corner piece.		
56	24	45.4	46.41	1.01	Yeah, it might go there!		
56	24	46.5	48.92	2.42	### See, see if you can find the other corner pieces.		
56	24	53.995	56.015	2.02	I don't think so, that doesn't look like it fits there.		
56	24	56.39	58.3	1.91	That looks like it goes with that though, doesn't it?		
56	24	59.39	59.69	0.3	Oh.

56	24	490.109	490.498	0.389	Yeah?		
56	24	492.014	494.226	2.212	So this guy looks like he's got part of an eye.		
56	24	496.11	496.517	0.407		*noise*	
56	24	496.889	497.712	0.823	Do you see an eye?		
56	24	499.6	501.715	2.115	On the flat side, see the flat side goes right here.		
56	24	505.88	506.411	0.531	Good job.		
56	24	506.648	507.905	1.257	I think you can do the rest.		
56	24	508.995	509.499	0.504	Let's see.

56	24	533.109	533.499	0.39	Nope.		
56	24	533.715	535.202	1.487	That doesn't, that's not right.		
56	24	536.11	537.596	1.486	The yellow, where does the yellow go?		
56	24	537.997	538.705	0.708	Whose yellow here?		
56	24	540.506	541.072	0.566	Whose yellow?

56	24	569.812	571.812	2.0	Points that way, so make it so it points that way.		
56	24	571.984	572.816	0.832	Where's the point on here?		
56	24	573.192	574.617	1.425	The one that points, sticks out.		
56	24	575.298	575.74	0.442	Like that		
56	24	576.707	577.123	0.416	Yeah		
56	24	577.309	577.831	0.522	There you go.

56	48	623.622	624.418	0.796		smaller ones.	
56	48	624.519	627.307	2.788	I know, smaller and all lots of the same color.		
56	48	629.83	631.335	1.505		This is going to be hard!	
56	48	631.418	632.843	1.425	I think its going to be hard.		
56	48	635.501	636.625	1.124		*noise*	
56	48	638.207	638.95	0.743	How should we do it?		
56	48	641.499	643.021	1.522		Let's, let's smoosh them up.	
56	48	643.229	644.432	1.203		Now, first.	
56	48	644.512	644.839	0.327	Okay		
56	48	656.813	657.442	0.629	Alright.		
56	48	658.903	660.434	1.531	Let's not let them fall though.		
56	48	662.339	663.542	1.203	Alright, what do we do first?		
56	48	665.105	665.53	0.425	What?		
56	48	666.056	666.834	0.778	That doesn't go there.		
56	48	667.318	667.956	0.638	You're silly		
56	48	667.995	668.438	0.443		*laughing*	
56	48	668.406	669.238	0.832	Let's find ones		
56	48	669.72	671.003	1.283	with two flat sides		
56	48	671.206	673.117	1.911	that go in the corners, thats how I like to do it.		
56	48	674.13	675.537	1.407	'cause then we can get the corners done.		
56	48	676.294	676.816	0.522		Like that?	
56	48	677.916	680.916	3.0	That could go there, yeah, bet you it might. But we don't know if it goes there		
56	48	681.46	682.399	0.939	Or if it goes there		
56	48	683.303	684.206	0.903	Or if it goes there.		
56	48	685.006	685.82	0.814	Or if it goes there.		
56	48	685.922	687.223	1.301	It could go four different places.		
56	48	689.46	690.336	0.876		Well	
56	48	690.601	690.823	0.222		it	
56	48	691.3	692.619	1.319		goes like that	
56	48	691.415	692.627	1.212	Wanna put it there for now?		
56	48	693.586	695.011	1.425	Let's put it there for now. Let's see		
56	48	697.613	699.126	1.513	Oop! What do you think, that's a corner.		
56	48	700.523	702.32	1.797	I don't know which corner though we have to find		
56	48	702.717	704.611	1.894	First we have to find another thing that looks like this.		
56	48	705.789	706.391	0.602	### go there		
56	48	706.643	708.236	1.593	Do you see something else that looks like that?		
56	48	710.518	711.226	0.708	What do you think that is?		
56	48	713.016	713.53	0.514	Plants?		
56	48	714.711	715.215	0.504		Maybe.	
56	48	716.619	717.822	1.203		That doesn't ### there	
56	48	717.799	720.817	3.018	Probably goes down here 'cause plants usually don't grow like that.		
56	48	721.506	722.205	0.699	They grow up.		
56	48	723.219	724.325	1.106	Do you see another plant?		
56	48	724.635	726.033	1.398	That one that looks like that plant.		
56	48	727.011	728.135	1.124		Hmmm...	
56	48	728.728	729.002	0.274	Yeah?		
56	48	729.533	730.214	0.681	See another one?		
56	48	731.408	731.709	0.301	Yep.		
56	48	732.359	733.129	0.77	Let's try to put these-		
56	48	733.102	733.518	0.416		###	
56	48	733.872	734.226	0.354		Oh!	
56	48	734.505	735.027	0.522		What is that?	
56	48	735.345	736.133	0.788	Oh! That's an ant!		
56	48	736.372	736.814	0.442	Oh look it!		
56	48	737.004	737.633	0.629	Look what I did!		
56	48	739.154	739.72	0.566		Good job!	
56	48	739.707	740.636	0.929	Where do you think that goes?		
56	48	744.995	745.419	0.424	Hmm		
56	48	745.596	748.605	3.009	I think there's probably not, no, I think there's probably an another piece that looks like that plant. 		
56	48	748.954	749.653	0.699	Maybe right here?		
56	48	751.909	752.432	0.523	*gasp*		
56	48	752.519	754.617	2.098	There you go! Where do you  think this, these three pieces go?		
56	48	755.935	756.413	0.478		Hmm	
56	48	758.194	758.911	0.717	Which corner?		
56	48	765.415	767.22	1.805	Yeah, that makes sense doesn't it? Good job.		
56	48	767.958	768.348	0.39	Alright		
56	48	769.219	770.52	1.301	### the top of this plant?		
56	48	773.314	776.226	2.912		Let's find some more red but not this red.	
56	48	776.208	779.013	2.805	Yeah, thats an ant. We'll put that over- Do you see part of the ant?		
56	48	779.782	780.809	1.027	Then we'll put it over there		
56	48	781.816	784.33	2.514	I don't think that's part of the ant, that looks like a bird's beak.		
56	48	784.603	786.913	2.31	He's got fruit inside his mouth.		
56	48	787.167	787.91	0.743		Hmm	
56	48	788.569	790.153	1.584	Let's see if we can find more of the plant.		
56	48	790.894	791.354	0.46	plants.		
56	48	792.309	793.814	1.505	Long red stringy plants.		
56	48	794.81	795.5	0.69		Let me see that	
56	48	796.15	796.628	0.478		piece.	
56	48	799.123	799.734	0.611		Hmm	
56	48	800.628	803.619	2.991	No, I don't think thats the same ant, there's two ants maybe.

64	24	1100.462	1101.167	0.705	Let's see.		
64	24	1102.109	1103.863	1.754	Turn it, might go this way maybe.

64	24	1108.511	1110.609	2.098	I wonder if they bottom pieces.		
64	24	1112.019	1113.38	1.361		Why'd you just push my arm?	
64	24	1114.421	1116.224	1.803	If I pushed your arm it was an accident.		
64	24	1117.371	1118.076	0.705	Relax.		
64	24	1118.379	1120.904	2.525		If I pushed your arm it would've been an accident.	
64	24	1119.805	1124.067	4.262	Relax, relax, and focus, let's focus on the puzzle please.		
64	24	1123.707	1125.772	2.065		But that's the part of the water.	
64	24	1126.297	1127.461	1.164	Focus on the puzzle.		
64	24	1129.158	1130.584	1.426		I got part of the water.

64	24	1161.936	1164.985	3.049		We don't know what this is. What is this?	
64	24	1165.673	1168.509	2.836	That looked like part of the octopus. That probably goes right here.		
64	24	1169.304	1171.091	1.787	See how it fits in there? Turn it around.		
64	24	1171.492	1175.197	3.705	Huh-uh match the colors up. See you got purple there? Turn		
64	24	1175.41	1176.77	1.36		Purple and purple.

64	24	1187.074	1189.009	1.935	That probably fits next to it somehow.		
64	24	1189.681	1190.648	0.967	Work this one out.		
64	24	1191.738	1193.508	1.77	Now lock it in. Good job.		
64	24	1194.459	1195.049	0.59	Keep going.

64	24	1229.835	1231.694	1.859		*laughing*	
64	24	1231.699	1233.503	1.804		No, you don't like sharks, do you?	
64	24	1234.144	1235.134	0.99	Not particularly.		
64	24	1235.704	1237.085	1.381	'Cause I don't wanna be eaten.		
64	24	1237.611	1242.046	4.435		Me either, I don't like sharks. But I do like pretend sharks.

64	24	1251.848	1254.674	2.826	Let's keep finding the pieces and stick 'em where they need to go.		
64	24	1253.935	1255.304	1.369		Let's look at the bottom.	
64	24	1255.26	1256.51	1.25	We need to check it out?

65	48	1661.654	1662.604	0.95	We did it.		
65	48	1662.759	1665.969	3.21	Okay let's see.  How about, where do you think this one goes?		
65	48	1667.034	1667.924	0.89	Right here?		
65	48	1667.939	1668.349	0.41		Yeah.	
65	48	1668.404	1670.744	2.34	Maybe.  We'll see if that's where it goes.		
65	48	1670.834	1671.344	0.51		Mm-hmm.	
65	48	1672.019	1673.309	1.29	Okay and this is the rest of him.		
65	48	1673.344	1673.584	0.24		Yeah.	
65	48	1673.434	1675.214	1.78	So, where does this go?

65	48	1677.324	1678.944	1.62	Good job.  Look at that!		
65	48	1679.284	1682.014	2.73	And how about this one? This looks like his eyeball.		
65	48	1682.409	1683.059	0.65	Up here?		
65	48	1683.514	1683.884	0.37		Yeah.	
65	48	1684.419	1686.169	1.75	Oh look at that! We're almost done!		
65	48	1687.344	1689.404	2.06	This looks like his beak.  Where do you think that goes?		
65	48	1689.484	1689.844	0.36		*noises*	
65	48	1689.864	1690.394	0.53	Beak?

65	48	1691.099	1691.989	0.89	Good job.		
65	48	1693.024	1694.284	1.26	Okay and let's see here.		
65	48	1695.904	1697.164	1.26	What about this piece?		
65	48	1697.174	1698.994	1.82		Yeah, maybe goes here.	
65	48	1699.944	1700.384	0.44	Where?		
65	48	1701.104	1702.094	0.99	Right here?		
65	48	1702.139	1702.419	0.28		Yeah.	
65	48	1703.029	1704.539	1.51	*gasp* It sure does!		
65	48	1704.674	1705.824	1.15	How about this guy?		
65	48	1707.649	1708.359	0.71		Them goes-	
65	48	1708.714	1710.944	2.23	I think this guy goes over here, what do you think?		
65	48	1710.969	1711.239	0.27		Yeah.	
65	48	1711.594	1712.904	1.31	That's the rest of the snake's head.		
65	48	1713.059	1714.189	1.13		*noises*	
65	48	1715.034	1717.904	2.87	And this piece means that goes right there?		
65	48	1717.929	1718.319	0.39		Yeah.	
65	48	1718.814	1719.114	0.3		Yeah.	
65	48	1719.184	1720.984	1.8	Good.  And then-		
65	48	1722.964	1723.484	0.52	This one.		
65	48	1723.494	1723.994	0.5		Mm-hmm.	
65	48	1724.094	1725.084	0.99	Goes right there?		
65	48	1726.859	1728.649	1.79	That means this one.		
65	48	1728.814	1729.604	0.79	You put it.		
65	48	1729.999	1730.719	0.72	You do it.		
65	48	1730.998	1731.948	0.95			48 piece ends
70	48	0.02	0.22	0.2			Experimenter in room.

70	48	0.4	1.65	1.25	Yeah, I remember this.

70	48	12.45	13.82	1.37	Cheetahs on the right.		
70	48	14.89	15.98	1.09		I knew where...	
70	48	15.35	19.64	4.29	Snake and the frog- and the little frog with the r- that's on the right.		
70	48	19.77	30.05	10.28	NAME		
70	48	29.515	29.905	0.39		Yeah.	
70	48	30.825	33.125	2.3	Or something, I think. I don't know. You ready?		
70	48	35.89	37.32	1.43	Oh, here's the picture on the back.		
70	48	38.47	40.13	1.66	So look right here, we need to see.		
70	48	41.655	42.735	1.08	Yeah, mix 'em up.		
70	48	44.985	46.475	1.49	Mix 'em up, break 'em up.		
70	48	47.185	48.925	1.74	Where you- don't knock them off the table *laughing*		
70	48	52.905	54.735	1.83		I'm a good breaker.	
70	48	54.775	58.335	3.56	No! You can't break them. I'm gonna- we can't do the puzzle.		
70	48	57.71	59.45	1.74		No, break like this.	
70	48	59.045	60.825	1.78	Oh, you mean like take them apart.		
70	48	61.45	66.09	4.64	You said- oh, you said you're good- you're good at breaking them? Is that what you said?		
70	48	66.305	67.105	0.8		Yeah.	
70	48	67.45	69.11	1.66	So you mean you're good at taking them apart.		
70	48	69.295	70.925	1.63		Well, look at that!	
70	48	71.345	73.355	2.01	I don't know if that fits, we'll have to try it.		
70	48	73.885	76.505	2.62	*noises*		
70	48	74.995	76.765	1.77		Seems like it does.	
70	48	78.74	80.92	2.18	Ready? Let's go.		
70	48	80.735	82.475	1.74		It does fit!	
70	48	82.14	91.5	9.36	Ok, so turn all pieces over first. No, turn them all over- a- here, so we can start seeing the picture...		
70	48	94.925	96.385	1.46	...of all of the pieces.		
70	48	100.89	101.71	0.82	Come on.		
70	48	103.485	111.985	8.5		"That fat snail- that blue fat snail said, ""Why do people keep calling me a girl?"""	
70	48	105.66	106.82	1.16	Uh-oh, we're losing them.		
70	48	111.715	114.115	2.4	*laughing* From Turbo?		
70	48	114.14	114.59	0.45		Yeah.	
70	48	115.11	115.64	0.53	*laughing*		
70	48	116.36	123.52	7.16	I asked Harmony which one does she like better, Despicable Me 2 or Turbo. Which one you like better?		
70	48	123.895	126.285	2.39		I like all.	
70	48	126.625	130.155	3.53	That's the same thing Harmony said. No, you have to pick one. I said which one do you like better?		
70	48	131.58	139.47	7.89		I like Spookoo Me- Spicable Me better and Turbo better.	
70	48	134.15	135.5	1.35	Yeah, me too.		
70	48	136.98	137.53	0.55	Hey, look.		
70	48	139.62	141.59	1.97	Ok, where you think this one goes?		
70	48	142.02	144.09	2.07		*noises*	
70	48	144.05	150.72	6.67	See the corner? It either could go there- it wouldn't go there, it- or there.		
70	48	151.28	153.22	1.94	Mmm, I think it goes there.		
70	48	154.145	155.145	1.0		Think it goes...	
70	48	154.71	157.5	2.79	It wouldn't go here. Can't fit.		
70	48	157.96	159.48	1.52	It goes straight up and down.		
70	48	160.245	164.115	3.87	Plus, that other red plant was up there with the ants.		
70	48	164.925	167.905	2.98	This one was up here. Come on, help me.		
70	48	168.525	168.905	0.38		*noises*	
70	48	170.44	172.9	2.46		What if it's just a ###?	
70	48	170.845	171.895	1.05	### 'em on.		
70	48	172.425	173.685	1.26	Where does this one go?		
70	48	175.46	176.98	1.52	Mm-hmm, put it up there.		
70	48	179.505	180.195	0.69	All the way up.		
70	48	181.345	182.715	1.37	All the way up in the corner.		
70	48	183.515	187.815	4.3	I don't know if it- pieces fit. Oh, it does go there! Good job, RJ!		
70	48	185.32	186.22	0.9		He fits.	
70	48	188.24	194.45	6.21	Ok, so let's start with this corner. So look for all the pieces with the ant or with this red plant.		
70	48	195.325	204.185	8.86	See, like here's one. Let's put it on the board. Here's another one. And then we can start just putting those together first.		
70	48	203.72	206.88	3.16		And then- I don't think it fits this way.	
70	48	207.46	212.25	4.79	No, it doesn't, 'cause see the picture doesn't match. So let's just see what else you can do next.		
70	48	211.925	218.975	7.05		*singing*	
70	48	212.795	219.035	6.24	What about any of these? What about these? Any green ones?		
70	48	219.055	219.625	0.57		Hmm.	
70	48	220.245	224.045	3.8	This looks like an ant, but it looks like it goes down at the bottom.		
70	48	223.93	224.83	0.9		Hmm.	
70	48	225.415	226.395	0.98	Does that work?		
70	48	227.0	230.83	3.83	Does it? Let me see. Hold on, wait, I think you got it.		
70	48	231.93	232.84	0.91		It matches.	
70	48	232.94	238.3	5.36	No, it doesn't fit. Let's try- no, it doesn't Rodney *laughing*		
70	48	235.325	236.595	1.27		It does fit!	
70	48	239.445	241.195	1.75	See? It moves out too easily.		
70	48	241.65	246.53	4.88	This is probably going to go either up here or over here.		
70	48	248.695	250.815	2.12	Mm-hmm, confusing. Let's see.		
70	48	253.87	255.11	1.24	How 'bout this one?		
70	48	255.795	257.845	2.05	Does that go right there? No.		
70	48	258.065	258.935	0.87		No.	
70	48	258.785	260.425	1.64	It doesn't go there. What about down here?		
70	48	261.25	264.3	3.05	*gasp* my, oh wow, got it!		
70	48	262.0	262.91	0.91		Yes.	
70	48	265.08	266.87	1.79		Oh, this goes in here.	
70	48	265.97	268.42	2.45	It's flat, so it's gonna go on a flat side.		
70	48	268.54	274.83	6.29	If it has a flat piece- look, look, look- look at me. Out of my way. If it has a flat side it goes to a wall.		
70	48	274.65	275.27	0.62		Hmm.	
70	48	275.535	279.165	3.63	Rodney, are you paying attention? It has a corner. It goes in a corner.		
70	48	280.215	281.595	1.38	Flat side goes on a flat side.		
70	48	282.0	284.65	2.65	What about trying- oh, there, see? That works.		
70	48	284.97	287.46	2.49	No, I'm sorry, it won't 'cause it's a flat side.		
70	48	288.78	290.1	1.32	So it goes like...		
70	48	292.045	293.495	1.45	Maybe it's over here, I don't know.		
70	48	293.725	300.035	6.31	Let's see, some of the pieces go with the hand. Oh, this one. This looks like those, right? See where that goes.		
70	48	307.705	308.785	1.08		No.	
70	48	309.63	311.77	2.14	It doesn't go on a wall 'cause it's not a flat side.		
70	48	312.605	316.205	3.6	How about trying to- trying to-		
70	48	317.23	319.02	1.79	*laughing*		
70	48	317.93	319.35	1.42		*laughing*	
70	48	319.645	320.395	0.75	Got it!		
70	48	321.795	325.405	3.61	Now, let's see, are the ants over here? I can't remember.		
70	48	325.885	327.705	1.82		*noises*	
70	48	330.73	331.37	0.64	Hmm?		
70	48	331.715	333.185	1.47		The ants are...	
70	48	333.665	335.535	1.87	They right- like here somewhere?		
70	48	335.68	338.22	2.54	Wait a minute, this ant doesn't- do you think he goes right there?		
70	48	340.815	347.605	6.79	Doesn't fit- nope, it doesn't fit. You can't force it. If they fit, then they go in easily.		
70	48	348.415	352.135	3.72	If they don't fit then they- *laughing*		
70	48	351.96	353.28	1.32		*laughing*	
70	48	355.285	357.365	2.08	Nope, doesn't fit. Don't force it.		
70	48	356.21	356.73	0.52		Nope.	
70	48	358.295	362.725	4.43	So that goes there. What about this one? Where do you think that one goes?		
70	48	366.035	367.265	1.23	Try right here.		
70	48	369.285	378.335	9.05	You gotta look at the picture. See, does that color match? Look, look, look- look at me. These colors don't match, right? So don't even press it. What about right here though? 'Cause that looks like that.		
70	48	382.255	383.735	1.48	That doesn't match, son.		
70	48	389.58	393.53	3.95	Good job, good job! So, let's see.		
70	48	394.31	396.96	2.65	Hmm, what's next?		
70	48	397.35	403.09	5.74	I think these guys might be down here. *gasp* Wait, I got an idea. What about this? Look, look.		
70	48	404.215	407.585	3.37	That goes to somebody's feet, right? No.		
70	48	409.585	411.605	2.02	*laughing* We did it.		
70	48	412.995	414.525	1.53	We're missing something.		
70	48	413.935	416.075	2.14		*noises*	
70	48	415.84	416.94	1.1	Aah...		
70	48	418.035	421.175	3.14		*singing*	
70	48	422.26	424.76	2.5		These go to somebody's feet.	
70	48	424.86	427.27	2.41	Does it? Oh yeah, try it. You good.		
70	48	427.97	431.72	3.75	You got it. Ok, then- let's get this over with.		
70	48	432.09	434.8	2.71		I wonder if it goes like this.	
70	48	435.04	441.95	6.91	It's a flat side. Where do the flat sides go? To the wall, right? So make it touch the wall and then fit it.		
70	48	443.465	451.955	8.49	Huh-uh. The flat side has to go into the walls. The flat side goes there, there, here, here. Try to make it fit down here somewhere.		
70	48	456.765	462.035	5.27	Yeah, put it- *noises*. Good job *laughing*		
70	48	458.965	464.925	5.96		*laughing* Now it looks like a spider.	
70	48	465.3	466.73	1.43	*laughing*		
70	48	465.56	469.61	4.05		It does because up close to it- and...	
70	48	473.28	474.3	1.02	Look what I found.		
70	48	474.005	475.435	1.43		And the legs.	
70	48	475.435	477.555	2.12	This one goes on that side, not on this side.		
70	48	477.01	478.2	1.19		*laughing*	
70	48	478.93	483.28	4.35	Ok, let's start- *noises*		
70	48	480.85	484.77	3.92		Let's start... *noises*	
70	48	484.155	485.435	1.28	Where does the butterfly go?		
70	48	485.52	487.11	1.59		Where does the butterfly go?	
70	48	487.04	490.33	3.29	Really? Alright, that's what you're gonna do now? You're gonna mock me? For real?		
70	48	490.06	491.93	1.87		*laughing* You gonna mock me? For real?	
70	48	491.81	492.96	1.15	I'm serious, RJ.		
70	48	492.75	494.28	1.53		I'm serious, RJ.	
70	48	494.47	497.22	2.75	I'm very serious, RJ. Look, I found another piece.		
70	48	495.58	497.33	1.75		I'm very serious, RJ.	
70	48	497.66	501.21	3.55	While you're mocking me, I'm finishing the puzzle before you. I'm gonna win.		
70	48	497.95	498.34	0.39		*noises*	
70	48	501.42	502.4	0.98		I'm gonna win.	
70	48	502.215	503.445	1.23	No, you're not.		
70	48	503.585	506.955	3.37		Aah, where is- does this go?	
70	48	507.905	513.315	5.41	Well, ok, he goes with some butterfly pieces. So let's start doing the butterfly.		
70	48	512.865	519.105	6.24		*noises*	
70	48	518.65	520.2	1.55	Ok, put 'em on here now.		
70	48	520.69	527.76	7.07		*noises*	
70	48	520.72	523.97	3.25	Which s- which side is the butterfly on?		
70	48	527.87	531.11	3.24		They should have a paper that we look on.	
70	48	528.095	528.975	0.88	Do you remember?		
70	48	530.84	532.96	2.12	No, come on, here. You supposed to remember.		
70	48	531.605	534.695	3.09		'Cause- 'cause I was looking on the other one.	
70	48	533.875	536.005	2.13	You were supposed to remember for me.		
70	48	537.085	538.755	1.67	Here, come on, let's hurry up.		
70	48	538.555	543.195	4.64		*noises*	
70	48	540.04	543.19	3.15	*noises*		
70	48	543.6	545.0	1.4	Let's make these pieces fit.		
70	48	545.37	550.52	5.15		Do some cheetahs- do some cheetahs eat...	
70	48	546.815	548.285	1.47	Here? No.		
70	48	548.905	551.695	2.79	Got another corner piece. Where does the corner piece go?		
70	48	552.375	553.065	0.69	Show me.		
70	48	554.185	555.735	1.55	Yep, good job.		
70	48	556.635	560.835	4.2	And that's gonna go... bam, found it.		
70	48	562.29	563.67	1.38	What about this one? You try that one.		
70	48	567.575	570.905	3.33	Bam! No, *laughing* psych.		
70	48	570.585	573.105	2.52		But it look- but it fits a little.	
70	48	571.28	572.37	1.09	*laughing* Look at this one.		
70	48	574.13	577.8	3.67	Yeah, but the pictures don't match, see? They have to blend.		
70	48	578.495	583.275	4.78	Maybe it's just something in between here. Maybe there's another piece that goes in between that one.		
70	48	587.48	592.0	4.52	What about... We need a flat one- put your foot down, man.		
70	48	593.28	594.7	1.42	Hmm.		
70	48	594.635	595.875	1.24		Hmm.	
70	48	598.02	600.81	2.79	Kinda. Wait, this goes here, RJ, look at that.		
70	48	601.28	603.08	1.8	But the mushrooms are upside down.		
70	48	603.045	613.365	10.32		*laughing*	
70	48	605.53	606.33	0.8	What?		
70	48	607.025	608.905	1.88	But it- hold on, it matches though.		
70	48	609.53	613.47	3.94	No, the flat side goes- the flat side goes to the wall.		
70	48	617.685	627.305	9.62	No, it doesn't match. Wait, hold on. It does match! See that  little piece of mushroom? That's crazy. Ok, now try your...		
70	48	619.41	627.3	7.89		*laughing* Why is...	
70	48	630.09	631.98	1.89	No, that doesn't go very good.		
70	48	632.65	633.48	0.83	Try this one.		
70	48	634.39	637.9	3.51		*noises*	
70	48	641.04	642.53	1.49	No, doesn't match.		
70	48	641.8	642.45	0.65		No.	
70	48	643.4	645.63	2.23	Let's see, *noises*		
70	48	645.32	647.23	1.91		*noises*	
70	48	646.8	647.49	0.69	Seriously?		
70	48	647.93	648.82	0.89		Seriously?	
70	48	649.36	651.19	1.83	Maybe this goes on a wall.		
70	48	651.52	652.81	1.29		Yeah, maybe.	
70	48	654.79	657.4	2.61	I'm so confused. I'm just gonna leave it there for now. Ok.		
70	48	657.98	659.2	1.22	And...		
70	48	659.805	663.475	3.67		Hmm, let's do that one. Wait!	
70	48	661.775	662.905	1.13	W- w- wait.		
70	48	663.365	664.375	1.01	What's up? What's up?		
70	48	666.855	669.915	3.06	What about it? They match! Yeah, that's what I was saying.		
70	48	668.85	669.64	0.79		Yeah!	
70	48	670.49	672.63	2.14	This one- look, where does that one go?		
70	48	670.51	671.42	0.91		They match.	
70	48	679.995	680.715	0.72	Good job.		
70	48	682.4	683.37	0.97	And...		
70	48	684.04	685.06	1.02		*noises*	
70	48	685.555	688.175	2.62	Mmm... Look what I found.		
70	48	686.08	689.25	3.17		*noises*	
70	48	689.78	690.62	0.84		Bam!	
70	48	690.785	692.295	1.51	Bam! *laughing*		
70	48	691.815	692.595	0.78		Bam.	
70	48	693.02	696.66	3.64	Wait, let's see. Bam! I'm on a roll.		
70	48	695.535	696.305	0.77		Where is...	
70	48	697.735	698.695	0.96	I'm beating you, man.		
70	48	699.22	701.01	1.79		Aah, where does this go?	
70	48	701.655	708.475	6.82	How about- It's part- *laughing* It's- it's his nose. If that's his eye, where would his nose be?		
70	48	701.67	703.19	1.52		Oh, tartar sauce.	
70	48	703.85	708.82	4.97		*laughing*	
70	48	708.76	712.79	4.03	How 'bout- you could start doing the cheetah's face now. You could start making his face.		
70	48	713.58	716.32	2.74		Mmm. That's cheetah girl.	
70	48	716.035	717.935	1.9	*laughing*		
70	48	720.38	723.12	2.74	These are going away. Here, this is a piece of him.		
70	48	721.7	725.51	3.81		*noises*	
70	48	725.275	729.205	3.93	Oop, that doesn't fit. You can't force it. Doesn't fit. Try it a different way.		
70	48	727.875	733.985	6.11		*noises*	
70	48	731.085	732.055	0.97	Try it a different way.		
70	48	735.085	736.035	0.95	Try right there.		
70	48	739.425	750.025	10.6	How 'bout like this? Look, if it doesn't fit this way, then- think about it. No, it doesn't fit, you don't force it. You turn it around and try it the other way. Now try it.		
70	48	758.97	759.9	0.93	It fits!		
70	48	759.83	760.74	0.91		It fits!	
70	48	760.52	761.96	1.44	Where does his nose go?		
70	48	764.485	765.845	1.36		I don't know.	
70	48	766.33	767.51	1.18	His nose?		
70	48	769.635	770.325	0.69		*noises*	
70	48	770.31	771.89	1.58	Just put his nose on.		
70	48	772.715	776.535	3.82		*laughing* I don't... know.	
70	48	776.3	777.73	1.43	You could try it.		
70	48	779.01	781.5	2.49	Let's see, this goes somewhere too.		
70	48	782.73	785.14	2.41	Does that go there? No, it doesn't.		
70	48	786.01	789.36	3.35		*laughing*	
70	48	788.295	791.595	3.3	Let me see. We're missing some pieces here.		
70	48	790.48	792.45	1.97		That one look like...	
70	48	794.28	799.3	5.02		Ooh, Pokey and... Pokey and...	
70	48	800.765	801.815	1.05	What?		
70	48	804.165	805.485	1.32		Pokey and...	
70	48	807.065	810.925	3.86	Hmm, why does it feel like we're, like, missing stuff.		
70	48	809.85	813.49	3.64		And Spikey *noises*	
70	48	812.135	816.755	4.62	Ok look. Look, let me start it. We're getting there, RJ.		
70	48	817.33	819.46	2.13	We're missing something else.		
70	48	818.14	819.35	1.21		Cheetah-bat.	
70	48	819.59	820.73	1.14	Oh, right here.		
70	48	819.79	820.88	1.09		Bat-cheetah.	
70	48	821.555	822.635	1.08		Bat-cheetah.	
70	48	823.49	827.1	3.61		Cheetah-bat with weapons on his hand.	
70	48	827.15	829.52	2.37	Is this space upside down or something?		
70	48	829.03	830.42	1.39		*laughing* No.	
70	48	830.24	831.24	1.0	It's strange.		
70	48	832.165	836.715	4.55		Yeah, but it's not upside down.	
70	48	837.385	840.955	3.57		*noises*	
70	48	837.885	839.705	1.82	Mm-hmm.		
70	48	841.36	844.38	3.02		Remember when- the snake!	
70	48	842.215	843.245	1.03	Ok, what's next?		
70	48	844.185	848.605	4.42	I'm kind of seeing the snake a little bit, but umm- we're still kind of missing some...		
70	48	848.18	849.63	1.45		*noises*	
70	48	850.0	851.2	1.2	Maybe...		
70	48	850.575	852.685	2.11		You're missing the snake.	
70	48	853.065	854.175	1.11	Hmm.		
70	48	853.495	855.455	1.96		And this goes here.	
70	48	855.46	858.81	3.35	Just hold on, let me check it out down here right quick. Hold on, let me check.		
70	48	859.39	865.73	6.34		Aah, watch out *noises* The frog... Mommy you're missing something.	
70	48	865.445	874.315	8.87	Hey, wait a minute *laughing* You did it upside down. RJ, don't shove it in my face. We're doing it upside down right there. That's why it's messed up looking.		
70	48	874.005	876.095	2.09		Oh!	
70	48	875.285	877.835	2.55	I knew these mushrooms were upside down.		
70	48	878.335	882.515	4.18	Look, this is the way- aah, look it makes sense now. Look at this.		
70	48	883.655	886.405	2.75	Look. *laughing*		
70	48	883.795	887.645	3.85		*laughing* Aah!	
70	48	888.475	890.805	2.33	We had it mixed up *laughing*		
70	48	891.255	895.675	4.42	Ok, so I'm gonna take these and turn them around.		
70	48	891.345	891.935	0.59		*laughing*	
70	48	894.51	896.09	1.58		But that's right!	
70	48	896.255	898.575	2.32	Yeah, but it's on the wrong side.		
70	48	896.84	898.31	1.47		*noises*	
70	48	899.23	902.26	3.03		Yeah, but it's on the wrong side.	
70	48	899.57	901.41	1.84	That's why it wasn't making sense.		
70	48	899.885	900.335	0.45			15 minutes.
70	24	1422.734	1423.194	0.46			Start 24.
70	24	1425.879	1427.039	1.16	*laughing*		
70	24	1426.664	1427.644	0.98		Look in the back.	
70	24	1430.769	1433.729	2.96	This- This one should be quicker. There's some bigger pieces.		
70	24	1432.294	1435.104	2.81		*noises* Ooh, these are bigger.	
70	24	1433.854	1434.804	0.95			Experimenter exits.
70	24	1435.474	1436.724	1.25	Yeah, but ###.		
70	24	1436.114	1438.644	2.53		Turn 'em around, turn 'em around.	
70	24	1441.044	1447.994	6.95		I'm a- I could still take them apart.	
70	24	1444.264	1445.994	1.73	*singing*		
70	24	1446.864	1456.564	9.7	I like these more than the puzzles better than the- the cardboard ones. Yeah, cause Hannah chews on the cardboard ones. You used to chew on them.		
70	24	1459.489	1461.119	1.63	When Harmony would have them.		
70	24	1461.279	1468.799	7.52		You remember that other place where ###, with Hannah?	
70	24	1464.974	1465.884	0.91	Uh-oh, I dropped one.		
70	24	1467.274	1468.394	1.12	I dropped one.		
70	24	1468.549	1469.279	0.73	Yep.		
70	24	1469.899	1473.319	3.42		And Hannah was screaming- was grabbing my toe or...	
70	24	1473.524	1474.704	1.18	Yep, I remember.		
70	24	1474.464	1476.934	2.47		When I was supposed to scribble scrabble.	
70	24	1476.764	1478.514	1.75	Ok. I remember.		
70	24	1478.184	1478.814	0.63		*noises*	
70	24	1480.214	1480.694	0.48		Ok.	
70	24	1480.449	1481.799	1.35	Did they have puzzles there too?		
70	24	1482.039	1482.749	0.71		Huh?	
70	24	1482.489	1497.229	14.74	Ok, so you gotta remember. Where's the shark? At the top, on the right. Whale's at the bottom on the left. Starfish is in the right corner. Jellyfish is in the left top corner. Ok? Bam, bam, bam, bam. Those are the ones you remember.		
70	24	1486.909	1487.599	0.69		And...	
70	24	1498.919	1504.339	5.42	Ok, let's go. Now, I'm gonna try to beat you. I'm not gonna let you win this time.		
70	24	1505.079	1506.389	1.31		Why?	
70	24	1506.139	1508.069	1.93	*laughing* Because.		
70	24	1507.854	1511.834	3.98		*noises*	
70	24	1509.014	1511.854	2.84	I'm ready, I'm ready.		
70	24	1512.099	1513.239	1.14	*laughing*		
70	24	1515.054	1517.124	2.07	This doesn't have a wall piece, RJ.		
70	24	1518.414	1519.204	0.79		Mmm.	
70	24	1522.844	1524.134	1.29	Come on. Hurry up.		
70	24	1530.199	1530.789	0.59	No.		
70	24	1532.484	1532.964	0.48	This one...		
70	24	1532.709	1533.179	0.47		Yep.	
70	24	1533.939	1535.469	1.53	No, it doesn't go there.		
70	24	1535.989	1537.119	1.13		Yes, it does.	
70	24	1536.969	1538.409	1.44	No, I'm gonna start with the shark.		
70	24	1539.089	1543.019	3.93	With the sa-hark. Sa-hark.		
70	24	1542.899	1544.009	1.11		Hark.	
70	24	1543.859	1547.719	3.86	You know, like they say on, umm, Word World? Sa-hark.		
70	24	1556.495	1557.245	0.75		*noises*	
70	24	1557.885	1561.745	3.86	Oh wait, maybe the shark goes up here.		
70	24	1562.79	1563.52	0.73	Bam!		
70	24	1566.05	1568.2	2.15		And another guy was up there.	
70	24	1569.1	1570.41	1.31		Who's this guy?	
70	24	1571.08	1572.42	1.34	That looks like the whale.		
70	24	1573.845	1576.165	2.32	And a whale of a tale, and a tale of a whale.		
70	24	1574.57	1576.16	1.59		It looks like he goes up-	
70	24	1580.505	1583.955	3.45	No, they don't- the colors don't blend. The colors have to match.		
70	24	1584.42	1587.71	3.29	This one looks good. Does it go at the top or in the bottom?		
70	24	1588.75	1589.98	1.23	Looks like he goes at the top.		
70	24	1593.02	1609.3	16.28	It- this does not match that. You can't force it on it. How 'bout trying it a different way? Nope, 'cause those colors don't match either. Colors don't match. Just wait. His face probably goes right here. You have to find a differen- another piece to go next to it. Leave it in the corner.		
70	24	1611.13	1614.5	3.37	Huh-uh, right there. How 'bout this one? Try the piece.		
70	24	1619.94	1621.92	1.98	You have to lift it up and put it onto it.		
70	24	1628.405	1628.845	0.44		*noises*	
70	24	1629.75	1632.11	2.36	Lift it up and place it in. There you go.

70	24	1640.515	1644.905	4.39	It looks like the same color, but it's not. It's not the same pattern or color.		
70	24	1646.205	1651.555	5.35	Huh-uh. That goes- that's- this is- look, this is a crab. You see crab legs? *laughing* That's not a crab.		
70	24	1652.785	1657.895	5.11	And the colors are different, ok? So here, try this one.		
70	24	1665.005	1665.905	0.9	Good job.		
70	24	1670.72	1672.89	2.17	Nope, this goes to a wall.		
70	24	1673.49	1676.41	2.92	This is flat, now. Goes to the wall.		
70	24	1677.04	1678.23	1.19		This is a wall.	
70	24	1681.93	1683.02	1.09	Mmm.		
70	24	1682.78	1683.72	0.94		Hmm.	
70	24	1683.985	1685.035	1.05	How 'bout...		
70	24	1686.925	1689.195	2.27		How 'bout we supposed to ### this?	
70	24	1690.865	1692.855	1.99	Umm, does that work? Yeah, it does work.		
70	24	1693.305	1697.125	3.82	Oh, this one goes right here, we're gonna find that one. How about this one? Try it out.		
70	24	1698.28	1699.2	0.92		Mmm.	
70	24	1702.595	1705.985	3.39		###. Yeah, it does. There.	
70	24	1706.125	1707.585	1.46	*laughing* Good job.		
70	24	1708.58	1709.98	1.4		Sea-star.	
70	24	1711.025	1712.905	1.88	What corner was the sea-star in?		
70	24	1715.87	1717.19	1.32	Good job.		
70	24	1718.365	1719.815	1.45	And...		
70	24	1723.095	1724.495	1.4	*laughing*		
70	24	1725.933	1733.443	7.51		This goes right here. That goes right there. This goes right here. That goes right there. This goes right here. That...	
70	24	1731.563	1734.343	2.78	Look, I found him while you doing that. I made the crab.		
70	24	1738.088	1739.638	1.55		Where does the sea-star go?	
70	24	1738.488	1739.778	1.29	Try that piece.		
70	24	1749.248	1750.198	0.95		Hmm.	
70	24	1750.188	1754.728	4.54	Huh-uh. Look at the colors. Where is- where do you see this color? Where you see crab?		
70	24	1758.033	1761.253	3.22	Mmm, not quite. Try a different way. Turn it around a different way.		
70	24	1766.078	1768.198	2.12		This looks like a shark.	
70	24	1768.193	1778.323	10.13	Yes, so think about it- let's turn it- let's- aah maybe it's not, but here, we know that we have the crab down here, right? So let's see. Oh no, that doesn't fit there.		
70	24	1778.993	1781.843	2.85	What about there? Does it fit that way? Does it match?		
70	24	1783.643	1784.223	0.58		Yeah.	
70	24	1784.138	1786.518	2.38	Ok. Get another piece.		
70	24	1788.903	1791.613	2.71	Why don't you look for a piece that fits right here so you can finish this side?		
70	24	1792.723	1794.073	1.35		Where, this?	
70	24	1793.023	1795.453	2.43	Look for these colors. Where do you see these colors?		
70	24	1795.993	1797.203	1.21		I see this.	
70	24	1797.158	1803.228	6.07	No, no, no. Here, look for- look for these colors. It's missing pieces of the crab, so look for the crab color.		
70	24	1805.638	1813.498	7.86	Turn it- no, no, now don't just put it in there. Look f- turn it in a direction. Where's the crab on this piece? Where do you see the crab arms?		
70	24	1814.65	1819.17	4.52	Does his eye go with that? Does the ### eye go with the purple and ebony?		
70	24	1820.025	1820.565	0.54		No.	
70	24	1820.67	1822.82	2.15	Well, where do you see eye? You see eye there, right?		
70	24	1822.81	1823.63	0.82		Yeah.	
70	24	1823.285	1825.535	2.25	So make the eyes match.		
70	24	1826.185	1828.765	2.58	'Cause eyes go side by side.		
70	24	1828.92	1831.33	2.41	See? Good job.		
70	24	1831.54	1832.87	1.33	Try this one.		
70	24	1834.13	1838.26	4.13	Nope, it's not a corner piece. It needs two walls. Two sides.		
70	24	1840.57	1840.88	0.31		Mmm.	
70	24	1844.28	1845.04	0.76	Good job.

70	24	1874.84	1878.71	3.87	Hey, where does this- where does the flat- which side of this is the flat side?		
70	24	1879.36	1880.67	1.31	Show me the flat side down here.		
70	24	1880.94	1881.8	0.86		Right here.

79	48	176.345	178.615	2.27		It doesn't look like it matches	
79	48	178.125	179.945	1.82	It doesn't match. No I think it does.		
79	48	180.11	181.97	1.86	See if the dots were in line up

79	48	318.22	319.13	0.91		*noises*	
79	48	321.175	326.675	5.5	Do you think it goes over there, or maybe

79	48	326.09	326.72	0.63		there!

79	48	331.715	333.375	1.66	Where are the other dots?		
79	48	333.515	334.545	1.03	Where do the dots go?		
79	48	335.21	336.82	1.61	And then you turn it around		
79	48	340.165	341.405	1.24		Nope it doesn't match!	
79	48	341.425	343.315	1.89	It doesn't match? Can mama try?

79	48	351.28	353.5	2.22	Okay. Ooh		
79	48	354.0	356.11	2.11	Let's see if we can get those dots to match		
79	48	356.255	357.685	1.43	You might have to turn it the other way		
79	48	360.0	361.02	1.02	Will that match?		
79	48	361.27	363.86	2.59		*noises*	
79	48	363.265	364.395	1.13	I don't think so		
79	48	366.67	368.7	2.03	Hmm. Oh! Here's some more dots!		
79	48	366.925	368.155	1.23		It doesn't match

79	48	382.76	383.25	0.49		no	
79	48	383.265	384.695	1.43	You don't think the dots go there?		
79	48	384.87	387.49	2.62	Cause it's got some blue of the butterfly		
79	48	387.68	388.83	1.15	You have to lift up		
79	48	390.875	391.895	1.02	Can you lift it?

79	48	412.575	413.815	1.24		This is a monkey	
79	48	413.845	416.135	2.29	That does look like a monkey. Well let's finish the butterfly!		
79	48	416.66	418.35	1.69	Let's finish the blue of the butterfly		
79	48	418.895	421.445	2.55	And maybe we'll finish the tiger spots		
79	48	421.94	423.5	1.56	Do we see any tiger spots?		
79	48	423.67	424.43	0.76		*noises*	
79	48	424.44	427.09	2.65	Well remember what goes on the bottom has to be flat		
79	48	427.725	428.955	1.23	What about up here?		
79	48	429.14	430.69	1.55	How bout turning it around		
79	48	431.685	433.365	1.68	So that the dots match		
79	48	434.095	435.945	1.85	So that the dots match		
79	48	436.07	436.44	0.37		yep

79	48	446.68	448.2	1.52	This way. Try that		
79	48	448.82	449.87	1.05	ta-da!		
79	48	450.975	453.275	2.3	Alright. So now what?		
79	48	453.775	462.335	8.56	Are there any other colors or dots that we need to put somewhere?		
79	48	463.445	464.925	1.48	What do you think?		
79	48	464.585	468.345	3.76		What is that, who is making that door noise?	
79	48	467.645	470.015	2.37	I don't know who's making that door noise		
79	48	470.24	472.89	2.65		Mayb- Maybe we'll have to go see and open the door!	
79	48	473.115	474.345	1.23	Well no we're not done		
79	48	474.99	477.51	2.52	Let's let's finish the puzzle. Then we can open the door		
79	48	477.6	478.24	0.64		###	
79	48	477.87	482.44	4.57	Where does this thing go? Should we put all of the pieces that are on the edges		
79	48	482.485	483.265	0.78	Look at oh!		
79	48	483.135	483.915	0.78		oh yeah!

79	48	504.02	506.9	2.88	It's hard to see all of these pieces over here		
79	48	508.01	510.28	2.27		These puzzles are really hiding!	
79	48	512.815	513.885	1.07	Oh oh careful		
79	48	513.12	514.46	1.34		Too many

79	48	536.745	538.385	1.64	Do you think that matches?		
79	48	538.545	539.665	1.12	Turn it around		
79	48	538.795	539.075	0.28		no!	
79	48	539.885	541.425	1.54	Turn it around. Try it like that		
79	48	541.745	543.845	2.1	See if it matches. No!		
79	48	544.165	545.335	1.17	What do you think?

79	48	643.915	644.805	0.89	Did that fit?

79	48	754.1	755.49	1.39	I don't think so		
79	48	756.215	757.355	1.14	Maybe it goes here		
79	48	757.545	759.185	1.64	With the red. In the red

79	48	770.715	771.875	1.16	Well maybe		
79	48	772.805	774.715	1.91	We should

79	48	777.405	780.555	3.15	Here's all the plant ah- Yeah!

80	48	411.58	414.04	2.46	Ok, do you see any- any other snake pieces?		
80	48	415.855	418.065	2.21		Maybe there could be here.

80	48	426.935	428.495	1.56	Or is it one of these leaves?		
80	48	428.9	430.83	1.93		It's this one of these leaves.	
80	48	430.23	433.18	2.95	Ok, but it doesn't look very much like a snake. *noises* this?		
80	48	432.19	433.01	0.82		Hey! I...

80	48	450.215	452.915	2.7	I know, but it's too loose. You wanna try next here?		
80	48	454.85	456.68	1.83		Ooh, it does fit.

80	48	470.58	477.45	6.87		Toucans- do you know they pa- pass the other berry to the other one and try to play catch?	
80	48	477.31	479.37	2.06	Really? Who told you that?		
80	48	477.915	478.415	0.5		Yeah.	
80	48	479.31	481.22	1.91		"In ""Cat in the Hat"" they wrote that."

80	48	490.17	491.44	1.27	Mm-hmm.

80	48	496.085	497.615	1.53		Do we see the ants on here?	
80	48	499.165	500.975	1.81		Oh, they're like that.	
80	48	500.685	501.795	1.11	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	502.285	505.135	2.85		We need two f- ant faces.	
80	48	505.685	506.725	1.04		Here's one.	
80	48	506.65	507.7	1.05	Mm-hmm.

80	48	523.635	527.095	3.46		Actually this does look like it'll fit. Yeah, it does.	
80	48	525.83	527.18	1.35	Mm-hmm.		
80	48	527.75	528.54	0.79		*noises*	
80	48	528.01	530.28	2.27	Oh! Whose legs could these be?		
80	48	530.73	532.85	2.12		Ants' leg.

80	48	538.52	539.62	1.1	There you go.		
80	48	540.465	542.075	1.61	Any other ant pieces do you see?		
80	48	542.235	543.615	1.38	I see one more mushroom.		
80	48	544.05	546.65	2.6		Hmm, there's one *noises*.	
80	48	547.155	549.155	2.0	Where are the other mushrooms in this picture?

80	48	557.025	563.205	6.18		Yeah, but first I gotta crumble it up then. Actually I don't, it's like this.	
80	48	562.86	566.05	3.19	Mmm, nice, you got that connected.		
80	48	566.605	569.075	2.47		And then this.

80	48	574.77	576.6	1.83	Now what, do you want to do the toucan?		
80	48	575.45	579.89	4.44		Now I just need long- no, I need longer legs for the ants.	
80	48	579.575	581.925	2.35	Oh, is it- are these legs maybe?		
80	48	583.065	585.645	2.58		No- oh yeah, these things are.	
80	48	583.74	584.88	1.14	These little things?		
80	48	587.105	592.835	5.73		###, I thought you were talking about these are legs. 'Cause these are just bushes.	
80	48	589.245	591.525	2.28	No, those are not legs.		
80	48	592.56	593.79	1.23	*laughing*		
80	48	595.7	598.39	2.69	So, what do you wanna do next? You wanna do the toucan?		
80	48	598.93	599.55	0.62		Mm-hmm.	
80	48	599.565	602.025	2.46	Ok, does this look like the toucan's eye?		
80	48	600.45	601.16	0.71		Act-	
80	48	602.33	603.1	0.77		Hmm?	
80	48	602.8	604.06	1.26	These look together.		
80	48	603.834	609.904	6.07		'Cause toucans' eyes are really colorful too a little bit, 'cause they're blue around.	
80	48	605.804	606.344	0.54	*noises*		
80	48	608.079	609.109	1.03	Mmm.

80	48	624.604	627.204	2.6	Does this look like the toucan's body or something?		
80	48	626.909	631.429	4.52		I think it's for this.	
80	48	632.034	632.584	0.55		No.	
80	48	632.184	634.654	2.47	Is it? How about the bottom of it?		
80	48	635.084	636.414	1.33		Yeah it is.

88	24	32.52	34.14	1.62	Let's figure it out.		
88	24	35.335	41.305	5.97	I don't know. It looks kind of like some tentacles, maybe? I don't know. No, here are the tentacles, right here.		
88	24	42.675	44.155	1.48	This matches up, right?		
88	24	43.67	46.72	3.05		Yeah, this is the octopus.

88	24	62.44	65.03	2.59	Well that doesn't match, right?		
88	24	66.3	70.83	4.53	Let's just kinda get 'em together. This looks like...		
88	24	71.55	72.63	1.08		For the crab?	
88	24	72.435	73.375	0.94	Yeah.		
88	24	73.755	75.985	2.23		Wait, no, we don't need this piece yet?

88	24	97.07	98.35	1.28	*laughing*		
88	24	98.775	99.925	1.15	What about that?		
88	24	99.845	100.695	0.85		Umm...

88	24	124.555	125.545	0.99	Yay!		
88	24	125.975	127.605	1.63		A jellyfish?

88	24	139.95	141.35	1.4		Why did you leave?	
88	24	140.375	143.985	3.61	What's another way you can, umm, show that you're excited?		
88	24	144.005	147.505	3.5		Umm, I don't know.	
88	24	147.16	151.41	4.25	Is that good? What goes here? What color is this?		
88	24	152.65	153.46	0.81		Gray.	
88	24	153.37	155.07	1.7	You see a gray corner?		
88	24	155.005	156.005	1.0		Mm-hmm.	
88	24	155.55	158.08	2.53	No, that's not a corner piece, 'cause look.		
88	24	159.99	160.76	0.77	How 'bout this?		
88	24	161.65	164.12	2.47		Mmm, yeah maybe.	
88	24	163.59	164.85	1.26	What does that look like?		
88	24	164.565	165.655	1.09		A shark!	
88	24	165.155	166.805	1.65	Yeah, that looks like a shark.		
88	24	166.925	168.365	1.44	You see the shark's body?		
88	24	169.39	172.23	2.84		This isn't the- a piece of the shark's body.	
88	24	171.235	172.515	1.28	Oh look, what's that?		
88	24	172.42	173.59	1.17		The teeth!	
88	24	173.2	174.09	0.89	Yes.		
88	24	174.05	175.04	0.99		What is this?	
88	24	175.35	177.47	2.12	*noises* I still don't know what that is.		
88	24	177.515	178.495	0.98	No sir.		
88	24	180.49	181.68	1.19		No siree!	
88	24	181.51	182.71	1.2	*laughing*		
88	24	182.845	187.015	4.17	Now we need a top, look. Don't you see how all the edges are flat?		
88	24	186.795	187.815	1.02		Mm-hmm.	
88	24	187.43	189.45	2.02	So it needs to be flat up there.		
88	24	190.455	191.735	1.28	You see something flat?		
88	24	192.16	193.05	0.89		Umm.	
88	24	194.23	199.07	4.84	That's flat but I don't think it matches. What about this? Well, what's this?		
88	24	197.255	197.835	0.58		Hmm.	
88	24	198.975	199.985	1.01		The tail.	
88	24	199.795	203.365	3.57	No, this the tail right here. What- do you know what this is called?		
88	24	203.535	204.415	0.88		Umm, no.	
88	24	204.69	205.94	1.25	The shark's fin.		
88	24	206.64	207.81	1.17		Oh yeah!	
88	24	208.76	210.27	1.51		*noises*	
88	24	210.17	211.13	0.96	*laughing*		
88	24	210.675	215.495	4.82		And the thing shows- it shows when it's in the water.	
88	24	215.43	216.1	0.67	Mmm.		
88	24	216.06	217.55	1.49		When it swims.	
88	24	217.35	222.9	5.55	Mmm- like *noises* Like that? *laughing*		
88	24	221.65	226.01	4.36		Yeah, but- it- but it's from his back.	
88	24	225.915	227.665	1.75	Aah, ok.		
88	24	226.735	228.845	2.11		*noises*	
88	24	228.485	230.975	2.49	Alright, let's go with this.		
88	24	229.855	242.005	12.15		Wait, remember we was trying to get the sharks in the thing at that thing on the boat? And people k- keep getting us? *noises*	
88	24	241.275	242.095	0.82	No.		
88	24	243.33	246.04	2.71		NAME	
88	24	250.01	251.05	1.04	I don't remember that.		
88	24	252.475	255.915	3.44		We needed to spray things at...	
88	24	254.98	258.97	3.99	Aah, at Great America.		
88	24	256.91	261.87	4.96		*laughing* Yeah, that was too scary.	
88	24	259.955	266.495	6.54	That was not scary to me, it was kind of annoying because everybody kept splashing us.		
88	24	268.16	269.16	1.0		You could have ducked.	
88	24	269.455	270.095	0.64	No.		
88	24	270.33	270.84	0.51		Why?	
88	24	271.19	272.82	1.63	It was nowhere to go.		
88	24	273.15	279.34	6.19		You could have ducked down and then- so they can shoot in the water- all.	
88	24	278.28	280.74	2.46	Now we're looking for this kind of piece, like that.		
88	24	281.955	283.725	1.77		With that cool?	
88	24	283.345	286.945	3.6	Were we pretending to s- to s- to fish on that boat?		
88	24	287.29	287.95	0.66		No!	
88	24	289.335	290.445	1.11	So what are you talking about?		
88	24	291.075	294.095	3.02		Like- they was spraying the water *noises*	
88	24	293.8	294.78	0.98	Mm-hmm.		
88	24	296.655	298.055	1.4		That's not fishing.	
88	24	298.54	301.31	2.77	No, but you was doing this. I thought you was talking about something like fishing.		
88	24	301.05	303.5	2.45		Yeah, you was doing this.	
88	24	303.27	310.05	6.78	Who was? I w-  oh, we were turning, umm, the cannons that shot the water out. I remember now.		
88	24	307.435	307.985	0.55		Yeah.	
88	24	309.975	313.435	3.46		I don't know what the- umm, I don't know how to do it, though.	
88	24	313.57	315.53	1.96	Do what? Oh, when we were doing that?		
88	24	315.795	316.655	0.86		Mm-hmm.	
88	24	316.82	319.77	2.95		But it needs to do it like this *noises*	
88	24	317.68	320.5	2.82	Alright, stay a little focused for this right here.		
88	24	320.385	321.345	0.96		Okay.	
88	24	321.24	326.01	4.77	I think that might go- is that it? Nope, turn it the other way, turn it around.		
88	24	329.191	329.821	0.63	No.		
88	24	330.781	331.621	0.84	No.		
88	24	332.336	336.266	3.93	This looks like this, see? So look for a piece that looks like this.		
88	24	338.306	338.966	0.66		Hmm.	
88	24	341.141	343.371	2.23	And it should have purple on it.		
88	24	345.571	347.621	2.05		I know where it is.	
88	24	345.591	346.521	0.93	You see it?		
88	24	347.901	349.261	1.36		It's on the puzzle.	
88	24	349.826	350.906	1.08		*noises*	
88	24	349.936	350.966	1.03	Try to s-		
88	24	352.331	355.521	3.19		Yep, it- it is. You're absolutely right!	
88	24	354.701	357.291	2.59	*laughing*		
88	24	356.711	358.211	1.5		Because I see purple.	
88	24	357.926	358.826	0.9	Right.		
88	24	359.381	362.631	3.25	So that was the piece that just wasn't facing the right way.		
88	24	363.381	364.841	1.46	Ok, let's finish the shark.		
88	24	365.616	366.116	0.5		Hmm.	
88	24	366.891	370.291	3.4		Ooh, this is part of the- ok.	
88	24	369.286	371.476	2.19	There you go. Yeah, good.

88	24	372.796	374.516	1.72	Thank you, Son.		
88	24	374.291	378.191	3.9		What? Why you say thank me sir?	
88	24	379.746	381.616	1.87	'Cause you're helping me with it.		
88	24	381.716	384.596	2.88		Ooh, he's trying to eat 'em!	
88	24	383.101	384.761	1.66	I think this goes with this.		
88	24	385.876	386.796	0.92		You trying to eat 'em.	
88	24	386.751	387.621	0.87	Mm-hmm.		
88	24	388.936	390.112	1.176		Eat what, though?	
88	24	391.383	394.032	2.649	Right. It doesn't look like he trying to eat anything.		
88	24	394.19	395.207	1.017	Not to me.		
88	24	395.777	398.374	2.597		It looks like he's 'bout to eat...	
88	24	398.067	399.663	1.596	Do you see another part of the crab?		
88	24	399.857	401.383	1.526	Well, I do.		
88	24	402.243	402.945	0.702		Yeah, me too.

88	24	408.341	409.166	0.825		No.	
88	24	409.096	411.043	1.947	You never ate crab legs?		
88	24	411.903	413.464	1.561		I don't eat crabs.	
88	24	413.359	414.552	1.193	You don't?		
88	24	414.245	415.701	1.456		No.

88	24	427.141	428.036	0.895		Hmm.	
88	24	428.299	431.088	2.789	Nope. Still not facing the right way.

88	24	451.706	454.372	2.666		I'm gonna do this jellyfish.	
88	24	455.276	460.68	5.404	It goes like this, but- you see a jellyfish?		
88	24	460.356	461.408	1.052		Mm-hmm.	
88	24	462.084	463.944	1.86	This not a jellyfish.		
88	24	463.813	464.935	1.122		What is that?	
88	24	464.752	466.173	1.421	I think it's coral.		
88	24	467.138	469.313	2.175		Oh yeah, it is a coral.

88	24	477.963	479.349	1.386	Where does it go?		
88	24	479.209	483.016	3.807		It goes here- wait, wait a minute.	
88	24	484.297	486.77	2.473	Mmm, no- hold on.		
88	24	485.735	486.437	0.702		Wait.	
88	24	489.904	492.869	2.965	This is some eye to something.		
88	24	495.729	498.325	2.596	This kinda looks like a dolphin, maybe?		
88	24	498.878	500.51	1.632		No, not that.	
88	24	500.405	503.422	3.017	No, not- yeah, good.		
88	24	504.273	505.238	0.965	Good job.		
88	24	506.027	507.15	1.123		This goes right here.	
88	24	507.616	508.335	0.719	Mm-hmm.		
88	24	508.007	517.814	9.807		Mom, dol- dolphins are not the- not the, umm- dolphins against, umm wha- this is a whale.	
88	24	517.533	519.481	1.948	Aah, it looks like a dolphin to me.		
88	24	519.095	520.604	1.509		But it's a whale.	
88	24	520.841	522.314	1.473	Mmkay, how do you know?		
88	24	521.937	523.849	1.912		Shark against whale.	
88	24	523.516	524.657	1.141	How do you know?		
88	24	524.955	528.867	3.912		Because. Because whales are blue.	
88	24	529.306	532.534	3.228	Dolphins are what color?		
88	24	532.175	532.964	0.789		Gray.	
88	24	532.824	534.701	1.877	Oh. Mmkay.

88	24	538.07	538.93	0.86	No.		
88	24	539.369	540.123	0.754		What is this?	
88	24	540.036	542.439	2.403	I don't know, but it's not a dolphin.		
88	24	543.001	545.106	2.105	This is a jellyfish, for sure.		
88	24	546.395	547.518	1.123	You can't put that there. Why?		
88	24	548.386	550.351	1.965		Umm, because it's not a corner piece?	
88	24	549.956	552.833	2.877	Mmm, yeah it's not a- a edge.		
88	24	554.315	555.859	1.544	This looks like an edge.		
88	24	554.745	555.237	0.492		Hmm.	
88	24	556.246	558.0	1.754		This looks like a edge too.	
88	24	557.922	564.571	6.649	No, 'cause it has bumps all- bumps and valleys and stuff.		
88	24	565.413	566.624	1.211		What are valleys?	
88	24	566.659	571.799	5.14	These dip- that's what I'm calling 'em, it's a dip. How 'bout this one?		
88	24	572.291	574.15	1.859		Mmm, okay. Let me try.	
88	24	574.483	575.168	0.685	Okay.		
88	24	576.413	578.729	2.316	It has to be on the edge, brother.		
88	24	580.661	582.748	2.087		I make that- wait.	
88	24	585.077	587.779	2.702	Oop, look. Try there.		
88	24	588.437	589.753	1.316	The edge.		
88	24	592.666	593.385	0.719	Yes.		
88	24	593.21	594.806	1.596		Oh yeah, it's a fish.	
88	24	595.263	596.596	1.333	Aah, like a swordfish?		
88	24	597.026	597.605	0.579		Yeah.	
88	24	597.412	598.254	0.842	Okay.		
88	24	598.14	599.509	1.369		What is a swordfish?	
88	24	599.642	604.747	5.105	This thing with the sword-looking type of nose thing.		
88	24	605.385	606.052	0.667	Go ahead.		
88	24	607.394	608.271	0.877		Hmm.	
88	24	609.637	611.303	1.666		Think it goes right there.	
88	24	611.742	612.549	0.807	I don't think so.		
88	24	612.979	613.698	0.719		Me either.	
88	24	614.733	616.084	1.351	Think this goes here.		
88	24	616.049	616.856	0.807		Oh, yeah.	
88	24	617.04	620.11	3.07	Alright, where does that go? Nearby, right?		
88	24	620.812	622.812	2.0		Yeah, right here.	
88	24	623.453	624.909	1.456	Huh-uh, not that way.		
88	24	624.892	625.453	0.561		Huh?	
88	24	625.462	626.883	1.421	Turn it the other way around.		
88	24	626.988	628.515	1.527	Right, mm-hmm.		
88	24	630.835	635.923	5.088	This is fun, we need to get some more puzzles at home. We actually have some, but we just don't do 'em.		
88	24	635.616	637.651	2.035		Wait! Watch this.	
88	24	641.169	643.661	2.492	Did you have fun wi- doing this with Mommy?		
88	24	643.038	643.704	0.666		Yeah.	
88	24	644.099	646.485	2.386	Yay! High five.		
88	24	644.196	644.617	0.421			End 24.

88	48	893.316	895.369	2.053		This is my favorite.				
88	48	895.772	897.0	1.228	What is this?					
88	48	897.247	898.492	1.245		A monkey!				
88	48	897.81	898.757	0.947			Experimenter exits.			
88	48	898.282	899.72	1.438	No, that's not a monkey.					
88	48	899.326	900.361	1.035		What is it?				
88	48	900.028	903.133	3.105	Think it's a lemur or something like that. It's not a monkey though.					
88	48	903.203	904.238	1.035		What is this?				
88	48	905.291	907.361	2.07	It looks like a jaguar.

88	48	912.71	913.745	1.035		Jumping frog?				
88	48	915.92	917.903	1.983		*noises* What is this?				
88	48	918.201	919.517	1.316	I told you already.					
88	48	919.798	925.57	5.772		I like the jaguars and the ants because they creep around *noises*

88	48	941.728	943.289	1.561		They're so little.				
88	48	946.688	949.6	2.912		Let's mix them up, Mom.				
88	48	948.68	949.767	1.087	Mix 'em up.					
88	48	951.985	954.441	2.456		Look, first let's turn them over.				
88	48	953.949	954.773	0.824	Okay.

88	48	979.97	983.005	3.035	I think with this one we need to figure out a strategy.					
88	48	983.04	984.601	1.561		What is a strategy?				
88	48	984.391	986.408	2.017	It's your plan of action.					
88	48	986.531	992.408	5.877	So do you wanna put, umm, that's- we can put the flat pieces in, the corners and stuff.

88	48	1190.677	1193.203	2.526	This look like another part of the nose.

88	48	1235.923	1240.502	4.579	I don't know. Here's some more pieces of the jaguar. Huh-uh, no, Son.					
88	48	1241.256	1244.344	3.088		*noises* I'm not right.				
88	48	1244.774	1248.458	3.684		I'm a- I'm not cool at this game.				
88	48	1247.941	1249.485	1.544	Alright, what about this?

88	48	1295.856	1299.066	3.21	Ok, but you're not- what'd I tell you about the ant pieces?					
88	48	1299.382	1300.049	0.667		Hey!				
88	48	1301.848	1302.936	1.088	Okay then.

88	48	1377.29	1382.693	5.403	This- this leaf matches this leaf, but this is not it. Do you see another leaf that's like this?					
88	48	1383.091	1383.548	0.457		Umm.				
88	48	1383.474	1384.334	0.86	Maybe that one?

88	48	1422.353	1428.476	6.123	This does go with these, it's just not that one. We need an end piece that's flat.					
88	48	1427.371	1429.599	2.228		End piece.				
88	48	1429.95	1433.284	3.334	Maybe this one? This one?

88	48	1447.145	1449.478	2.333		Oh, *noises*				
88	48	1447.724	1449.32	1.596	Or on a side.

88	48	1473.426	1474.373	0.947	How 'bout this one?					
88	48	1474.856	1475.838	0.982		Maybe.				
88	48	1475.584	1479.058	3.474	Try that, 'cause that looks like ###, on the legs.

88	48	1511.149	1517.255	6.106	Mushrooms or- nope, that's not it.					
88	48	1518.116	1524.449	6.333		*laughing* Yep. Yes siree, a yes siree.				
88	48	1519.993	1521.063	1.07	This goes here.					
88	48	1523.695	1527.186	3.491	Alright, look for mushrooms on a flat piece. Maybe that one.					
88	48	1527.818	1528.59	0.772		'Kay.

89	48	271.64	273.08	1.44	Does that look like it could be part of it?

90	48	99.86	103.37	3.51	Let's see if there's room for another piece. See how I'm putting all the reds together?	
90	48	103.83	108.13	4.3	I'm trying to figure ways to put them together.	
90	48	108.25	113.18	4.93	Okay, so that doesn't go there. Let's try- what about this way? Does it go this way?	
90	48	113.63	114.21	0.58		No.

90	48	153.96	156.61	2.65	I bet these two might go together some kind of way.

90	48	173.48	174.63	1.15	I think the last one.	
90	48	175.45	177.01	1.56	Let's see maybe this goes here.

90	48	312.35	317.57	5.22	His nose doesn't go up here, does it? Because if you turn around, he's looking at you. So what should his nose go up or down?	
90	48	318.175	319.715	1.54		Up, up, up!
90	48	319.81	323.4	3.59	Are you sure? Is your nose up here or down here under your eyes?

92	24	14.98	17.85	2.87	NAME		
92	24	21.39	22.56	1.17			Experimenter exit
92	24	29.21	31.51	2.3	What is- an octopus and a shark.		
92	24	36.1	39.58	3.48	What is this?  I- 		
92	24	39.565	41.195	1.63		That's just seaweed.	
92	24	41.165	42.325	1.16	Seaweed, okay.		
92	24	43.75	45.84	2.09		You know what all that is. You know stuff.	
92	24	45.86	48.14	2.28	I know what all the other sea creatures are.		
92	24	50.41	53.16	2.75	This little whale has barnacles. See the barnacles?		
92	24	53.72	55.01	1.29		What are those for?	
92	24	55.02	65.94	10.92	Barnacles? Barnacles, I think, are like little creatures who just attach themselves to boats and then sometimes to whales.		
92	24	73.815	75.285	1.47	I miss the full sun.		
92	24	76.065	76.855	0.79		Me too	
92	24	76.805	77.865	1.06	You miss the sun too?		
92	24	79.9	82.42	2.52		Maybe you should get the boogers out	
92	24	82.53	87.49	4.96	*laughing* I could blow my nose. That would work. I just did blow my nose though.		
92	24	88.225	89.825	1.6	Are you gonna take them all out?		
92	24	91.82	94.94	3.12	I like to just dump all the pieces out.		
92	24	96.75	98.9	2.15		###	
92	24	104.43	109.25	4.82	So, she said the piece has twenty-four- this puzzle has twenty-four pieces.		
92	24	110.515	111.905	1.39	Ooh, okay.		
92	24	112.615	115.745	3.13		I thought that some other pieces can sit here.

92	24	124.75	125.58	0.83		*noises*	
92	24	125.07	127.24	2.17	Do you have food in your teeth? No?		
92	24	130.89	133.82	2.93	That's actually- if you do that too much, it's not good for your teeth.		
92	24	134.75	138.44	3.69	It's like sometimes you can- you grind your teeth and your teeth can get worn down.		
92	24	139.06	141.08	2.02	So it's not good to do that very often.		
92	24	141.685	142.305	0.62	Okay		
92	24	142.98	144.89	1.91		I want you to help me.

92	24	147.52	150.91	3.39	So let's see. You wanna start with the edges?		
92	24	151.53	154.48	2.95	Mmkay. So, let's- do you wanna- let's separate out the edges.		
92	24	157.25	157.96	0.71	'Kay		
92	24	160.08	160.89	0.81	All right		
92	24	161.43	162.59	1.16		Not here.	
92	24	162.475	165.115	2.64	Not there. Is that where it goes? This- this is a corner.		
92	24	165.16	166.83	1.67		Right here *noises*	
92	24	168.64	169.96	1.32		Right here.	
92	24	170.88	178.14	7.26		Right here- right here- right here- right here- right here- right here.

92	24	173.771	175.781	2.01	*laughing*		
92	24	177.061	178.651	1.59	Okay- okay.		
92	24	179.341	183.271	3.93		What if it was not here, not here, not here, not here.	
92	24	179.871	182.661	2.79	Have you- did- is this one of the puzzles you did with her before?		
92	24	183.371	183.941	0.57	'Kay		
92	24	183.731	185.761	2.03		Then have to go in the middle!	
92	24	185.38	191.24	5.86	Here we go. Here is an edge.  Here's another one with straight- that's a corner.		
92	24	191.14	196.87	5.73		No- we- I need it- it to be just on the corner.	
92	24	196.84	199.11	2.27	Ooh you just want the corners.  Well, this is a corner.		
92	24	199.91	201.32	1.41		Corner pieces	
92	24	200.59	201.39	0.8	Mm-hmm		
92	24	203.335	205.155	1.82		I'm missing the top corners.	
92	24	205.21	207.2	1.99	'Kay. Well, look for the corners. Let's see.		
92	24	213.52	216.5	2.98		These ### corners	
92	24	216.115	218.115	2.0	Yep, ooh you found one. Good job.		
92	24	219.11	224.38	5.27		Right here or right here	
92	24	223.99	227.38	3.39	That's, I think, the shark's fin. Where's the other corner?		
92	24	227.74	229.11	1.37		I think that's-	
92	24	231.22	232.24	1.02	NAME		
92	24	233.605	235.275	1.67	Ooh that's good. That's a match.		
92	24	238.88	241.66	2.78	You looking for the other corner or you're just-  ooh you looking for that piece.		
92	24	242.475	243.085	0.61	'Kay		
92	24	250.065	253.595	3.53	This, I think, is part of the octopus.		
92	24	254.605	256.325	1.72	Right? 'Cause those are the tentacles.		
92	24	258.82	260.29	1.47	I think this is the crab.		
92	24	261.17	262.9	1.73		I think this goes here.	
92	24	261.34	262.17	0.83	Where's the crab?		
92	24	264.01	264.67	0.66		*laughing*	
92	24	264.325	265.775	1.45	*laughing*		
92	24	266.585	269.365	2.78		Where's another crab piece that goes here?	
92	24	269.1	269.87	0.77	Here it is.		
92	24	270.06	271.83	1.77	I think- I don't think that's the one.		
92	24	272.39	273.8	1.41	That's like the jellyfish.		
92	24	274.56	276.63	2.07	And then here's part of a crab.		
92	24	291.16	292.98	1.82		That's part of a seahorse.	
92	24	293.505	295.015	1.51	I think that's an eyeball.		
92	24	295.285	298.075	2.79		*laughing* That's an eyeball in an eye.	
92	24	298.035	300.485	2.45	Mm-hmm but it's an edge though.		
92	24	302.495	303.985	1.49		Does it go here?	
92	24	304.025	306.615	2.59	No, I don't see- the colors don't match.		
92	24	309.37	311.68	2.31	There you go.  That's a perfect match.		
92	24	317.19	318.53	1.34		*noises*	
92	24	318.575	320.475	1.9	You wanna try it the other way? Good job.		
92	24	321.69	322.53	0.84	Does that work?		
92	24	323.155	324.405	1.25	Yes, good job.		
92	24	325.645	326.395	0.75	There you go.

92	24	327.285	327.745	0.46	'Kay		
92	24	329.05	332.46	3.41	So that was like the seahorse's head. There's the body.		
92	24	335.26	337.06	1.8	And the eyeball.		
92	24	337.805	338.975	1.17		###	
92	24	338.985	340.495	1.51	I think that's the whale's eye.

92	24	373.03	373.64	0.61		No	
92	24	395.41	399.06	3.65	You're so fast! I don't even have a chance to know where you're gonna put it.		
92	24	399.85	401.51	1.66	You- very good.		
92	24	406.625	407.155	0.53	Great job.

92	48	472.615	473.935	1.32		Is that a rattle snake?	
92	48	473.99	477.26	3.27	Umm I don't think it's a rattle snake.		
92	48	477.72	482.64	4.92	Maybe it's like a python or- yeah maybe a python.		
92	48	481.795	483.705	1.91		We can't see the *noises*	
92	48	483.53	485.09	1.56	We can't see the rattles on the end.		
92	48	485.215	489.885	4.67	And there's a frog and another frog.  I think those are red-eyed tree frogs.		
92	48	490.295	492.135	1.84	And I think that's a sloth.		
92	48	493.76	496.7	2.94	And a pretty butterfly and that is a-		
92	48	496.685	497.625	0.94		A leopard.

92	48	543.12	547.64	4.52	Shall we dump the puzzle over? Can we do it mommy's way this time and just flip it over?		
92	48	544.905	545.585	0.68		No.	
92	48	547.79	548.44	0.65		No.	
92	48	548.47	549.29	0.82	Why not?		
92	48	549.61	557.15	7.54		Because that can't be-	
92	48	558.64	560.17	1.53		That can't be	
92	48	560.56	561.65	1.09	No? Why can't you?		
92	48	560.82	563.59	2.77		You can put it together on the table.	
92	48	565.83	567.85	2.02		You can put it together on the table.	
92	48	567.81	573.78	5.97	Alright, but I think it would be so much faster if we just flipped all the pieces out.		
92	48	573.83	574.41	0.58		No	
92	48	574.505	576.895	2.39	You wanna take them- why do you wanna take them out one by one?

92	48	630.765	633.495	2.73		Because it- there's a lot of green in the puzzle.	
92	48	633.28	638.92	5.64	Yep so it's- it's in- it's in the rainforest.

92	48	642.45	646.89	4.44	Yes, rainforest is lush and green 'cause it gets lots and lots of land.		
92	48	647.125	649.475	2.35		Now this is your piece.	
92	48	649.515	650.625	1.11	Okay, now we go-		
92	48	650.335	652.565	2.23		How many pieces does this have?	
92	48	652.475	655.375	2.9	Umm I don't remember what she said.		
92	48	655.9	658.29	2.39	I think the last one was 24 pieces.		
92	48	662.03	665.11	3.08	Sixteen- seventeen- eighteen- nineteen- twenty- twenty-one- twenty-two- twenty-three- twenty-four		
92	48	665.3	671.46	6.16	I think there are twenty-four pieces over here. Probably twenty-four pieces over here so I think this is a forty-eight piece puzzle.		
92	48	672.14	674.41	2.27	That's almost fifty. That's a lot of pieces.		
92	48	674.68	677.8	3.12		I really like your earrings.  I wanna take them.	
92	48	677.935	680.225	2.29	Well- but you told me I had to wear these today.		
92	48	679.745	682.485	2.74		I put it- I can put it- put it on.	
92	48	681.08	682.43	1.35	Put it on. Can you put it on here?		
92	48	684.86	685.83	0.97		*noises*	
92	48	685.33	685.95	0.62	Can you do it?		
92	48	686.795	688.125	1.33	Make sure you get it in the hole.		
92	48	694.7	696.89	2.19	Okay, so what should we put together first.		
92	48	697.35	699.88	2.53		I know how to put on an earring ###	
92	48	698.99	701.11	2.12	You do! Yes, you do.		
92	48	701.14	707.5	6.36		But not the earrings that have that close. I just know how to put on the earrings that have-	
92	48	707.29	710.7	3.41	Ooh you mean the ones that have the clasps that goes on the back.		
92	48	710.83	713.39	2.56	Yeah, these are just the little hooks.  Those are easier.		
92	48	713.91	718.71	4.8	Okay, so which- which- how should we put this puzzle together?		
92	48	714.785	715.905	1.12		###	
92	48	718.875	720.305	1.43	This is a more challenging puzzle.		
92	48	720.925	722.635	1.71		'Cause it has smaller pieces.	
92	48	722.415	724.285	1.87	It has smaller pieces and more of them.		
92	48	724.93	729.88	4.95	So do you wanna start with edges or do you wanna put together them by animal by animal?		
92	48	731.49	733.19	1.7		Start with the edges.	
92	48	733.195	734.025	0.83	Hmm		
92	48	735.68	740.41	4.73	'Kay now what- which part- which animal part is this? This is part of what animal?		
92	48	740.92	742.14	1.22		The butterfly.	
92	48	741.595	743.925	2.33	The butterfly so when could like-		
92	48	746.87	750.26	3.39	Ooh look. You're doing edges and animal by animal.  You're doing both ways.		
92	48	757.14	759.58	2.44		We have all the butterfly parts.	
92	48	759.635	760.435	0.8	Mm-hmm		
92	48	767.7	769.98	2.28		Wonder where this pieces goes.	
92	48	769.81	772.08	2.27	Well, you have to try it all of the spots.		
92	48	772.73	776.51	3.78	And you have to try it all the different ways.  Turn it in every direction.		
92	48	783.765	787.105	3.34	And not get discouraged or frustrated.		
92	48	790.35	791.5	1.15	That's very good.		
92	48	795.77	797.12	1.35	 Didn't really go down.		
92	48	799.19	804.6	5.41	Ooh I thought that piece was gonna go the other way 'cause I thought the nose went the other way.		
92	48	804.78	807.47	2.69	But you did it in the right direction.		
92	48	809.19	814.16	4.97		That's because my brain really reminds me ### of things.	
92	48	812.04	813.39	1.35	Your brain reminds you?		
92	48	814.26	815.05	0.79	That's good.		
92	48	815.24	818.33	3.09	So I think you finished the butterfly. Which animal are you gonna work on next?		
92	48	819.35	820.2	0.85		a leopard	
92	48	820.08	821.49	1.41	Mmkay that makes sense.		
92	48	823.85	826.93	3.08	Get the leopard. Is it a leopard? Did we say it was a leopard?		
92	48	827.085	827.805	0.72		Yeah.	
92	48	827.86	828.49	0.63	Okay		
92	48	828.69	829.4	0.71		Leopard	
92	48	829.46	831.86	2.4	Look at those pretty green eyes the leopard has.		
92	48	833.885	835.495	1.61	Here's another eye piece.		
92	48	836.785	837.895	1.11	Why don't you do that, okay?.		
92	48	840.61	842.52	1.91	And that's got a ###		
92	48	851.77	852.41	0.64	Good job.		
92	48	853.805	855.115	1.31	NAME		
92	48	855.825	856.895	1.07	NAME		
92	48	857.145	859.105	1.96	Did we get all the leopard pieces?		
92	48	860.67	865.26	4.59	Maybe let's see- ooh, there you go.		
92	48	863.41	864.88	1.47		Here's part of the ear.	
92	48	866.43	868.79	2.36	I think we both saw that piece at the same time.		
92	48	869.245	870.025	0.78	There you go.		
92	48	876.58	879.24	2.66	NAME		
92	48	881.0	881.53	0.53	Okay		
92	48	881.3	882.68	1.38		I still got more	
92	48	884.005	887.025	3.02	Is there another part of the ear? What color are we looking for?		
92	48	887.81	889.97	2.16		There's still part of the leopard, see?	
92	48	889.95	896.06	6.11	I aah- what color should the piece- maybe is it- what else is around it?		
92	48	896.19	897.92	1.73	Did you find it? Hmm-		
92	48	898.6	899.9	1.3	It's kind of like a-		
92	48	902.82	905.79	2.97	Ooh look, I think this might be it. That has a spot on it.		
92	48	906.86	908.18	1.32	I'm going to go shut this now 		
92	48	916.545	917.935	1.39		###	
92	48	918.045	919.005	0.96	Alright.		
92	48	919.43	921.0	1.57	I think that's a mushroom.		
92	48	921.56	923.39	1.83		Yeah those are mushrooms.	
92	48	923.19	923.76	0.57	Okay		
92	48	924.21	930.65	6.44	Mushrooms like umm- they like dark places- places that don't get a lot of sun.		
92	48	931.84	937.69	5.85	Mushrooms grow where it's wet. It's kind of wet and not too sunny.		
92	48	938.88	941.5	2.62	Alright, what are we gonna do next? What animal should we do next?		
92	48	941.865	945.105	3.24		Aah I'm gonna do this.	
92	48	945.1	946.37	1.27	Ooh okay		
92	48	947.28	949.88	2.6	That's a pre- I think- I don't know what kind of flower that is.		
92	48	950.795	951.895	1.1	Ooh okay.		
92	48	952.64	954.68	2.04		We can do two at a time.	
92	48	955.575	957.195	1.62	Ooh here's another mushroom.		
92	48	955.66	956.17	0.51		###	
92	48	960.37	962.29	1.92		We need to find it's top.	
92	48	962.425	964.295	1.87	The top of the mushroom? Ooh!		
92	48	965.955	966.795	0.84	It' s not gonna work.		
92	48	969.17	969.79	0.62	Okay		
92	48	971.205	972.155	0.95	Now, what's next?		
92	48	975.81	976.8	0.99		Snake.	
92	48	977.21	978.03	0.82	The snake.		
92	48	995.575	996.855	1.28	Try a different piece.		
92	48	1001.45	1002.18	0.73	Hmm		
92	48	1003.68	1007.7	4.02	This part is definitely challenging.  Do you wanna look for the corner piece?		
92	48	1008.585	1010.935	2.35	That might go here. That might help us a little bit.		
92	48	1013.485	1014.415	0.93	Did you find one?		
92	48	1015.89	1020.74	4.85	That's an edge and a corner has two straight edges.		
92	48	1025.31	1026.15	0.84	Here's a corner.		
92	48	1027.355	1029.075	1.72	See the two straight edges?		
92	48	1030.75	1032.71	1.96	That is the corner we needed. Okay.		
92	48	1035.515	1036.805	1.29		That's a ###	
92	48	1037.12	1045.13	8.01	Yeah that's just- this piece- look, this piece is green and then it has a little stripe of red on it.		
92	48	1057.99	1059.79	1.8	Ooh there you go. You did it.		
92	48	1062.35	1064.42	2.07	Is that what you meant by two at a time?		
92	48	1079.46	1080.81	1.35		Look at this piece.	
92	48	1082.22	1083.98	1.76	That looks like a leaf.		
92	48	1084.63	1091.27	6.64	A part of a leaf with a little tiny bit of maybe sky- a little bit of blue and red.		
92	48	1102.035	1104.715	2.68	Hmm I think you might be forcing that one in.		
92	48	1105.79	1107.7	1.91	And plus look, it has an edge.		
92	48	1107.92	1109.77	1.85	So if it has an edge, should it be right there?		
92	48	1110.49	1111.9	1.41	Yeah, it needs to be up higher.		
92	48	1113.51	1114.25	0.74		Up here	
92	48	1114.215	1116.585	2.37	Like along the edge of the puzzle, yes.		
92	48	1135.125	1136.735	1.61		What's that green stuff? 	
92	48	1136.955	1139.065	2.11	That's probably moss.		
92	48	1140.34	1146.85	6.51	Moss also likes to grow where it's dark and very damp or wet.		
92	48	1147.61	1149.53	1.92	Right? Where there's not a lot of sun.		
92	48	1150.685	1153.015	2.33		But, I really like the butterfly.	
92	48	1152.725	1154.255	1.53	I like the butterfly too.		
92	48	1154.895	1157.665	2.77		I wonder where this piece goes- maybe with this piece.	
92	48	1157.74	1167.48	9.74	Well, I think we should hold off on that piece because that looks like part of a fern, like a fern plant- like a ### fern.		
92	48	1166.135	1170.035	3.9		### place.	
92	48	1171.03	1178.37	7.34	*singing* Ooh look what I found. A piece with a little bit of red and a little bit of blue.		
92	48	1179.9	1183.04	3.14	Remember, which piece had a little bit of red and a little bit of blue?		
92	48	1183.365	1184.685	1.32	Was it the piece with the fern?		
92	48	1186.68	1192.07	5.39	All right! So that's a match, but maybe not close by. We can save that for later.		
92	48	1191.965	1193.645	1.68		Look at these.	
92	48	1194.22	1197.8	3.58		Wait, let's put these right here.	
92	48	1197.725	1198.285	0.56	Okay		
92	48	1198.31	1204.19	5.88		That's the left-over until we find two more pieces.	
92	48	1204.205	1204.835	0.63	Okay.		
92	48	1208.05	1208.76	0.71		Ants	
92	48	1210.69	1212.22	1.53	Busy, busy ants.		
92	48	1212.58	1215.97	3.39	Here's some more ant pieces. There's an ant piece- there's an ant piece.		
92	48	1217.34	1219.14	1.8	I found two more ant pieces for you.		
92	48	1221.01	1223.48	2.47	Ooh and look. What do you see on this branch?		
92	48	1224.92	1226.75	1.83	What's that called again? Do you remember?		
92	48	1228.07	1228.72	0.65		I don't know	
92	48	1228.71	1232.89	4.18	Moss, like mossy.		
92	48	1233.285	1233.915	0.63	*laughing*		
92	48	1235.1	1240.09	4.99		I need more ant pieces.	
92	48	1235.73	1237.35	1.62	You did not get that joke, okay.		
92	48	1240.22	1242.23	2.01	I found two ant pieces for you.		
92	48	1244.07	1245.12	1.05	Is that the right one?		
92	48	1248.23	1250.15	1.92	Here's another little piece. Try that one.		
92	48	1252.0	1258.65	6.65	NAME		
92	48	1274.93	1276.13	1.2	Ooh that was quick.		
92	48	1298.045	1302.415	4.37	Now, let's bring some of these pieces closer so we can take a look at those.		
92	48	1303.585	1304.795	1.21	Figure out where those go.		
92	48	1311.415	1312.495	1.08	That's the-		
92	48	1314.79	1316.16	1.37	Do you remember what this animal is?		
92	48	1317.68	1321.16	3.48	I think it's a sloth because of its long claws.		
92	48	1327.58	1328.41	0.83		What's this?	
92	48	1328.7	1330.16	1.46	Ooh that's a good question.		
92	48	1330.28	1337.43	7.15	That's probably, maybe another kind of moss, maybe.		
92	48	1340.53	1341.13	0.6	I know		
92	48	1342.745	1344.275	1.53	I think that's another kind of moss.		
92	48	1344.475	1347.055	2.58	Here's something else that kind of cloudy and hazy.		
92	48	1348.72	1349.48	0.76	Here we go.		
92	48	1349.945	1351.455	1.51	That's the sloth's body.		
92	48	1352.345	1353.795	1.45	We're making good progress!		
92	48	1354.005	1356.415	2.41	We've done half of the puzzle.		
92	48	1357.495	1359.335	1.84	More than half of the puzzle.		
92	48	1361.97	1363.0	1.03			15 minute
93	24	0.015	0.321	0.306			24 piece - start
93	24	3.094	3.742	0.648	You gonna dump it out?		
93	24	10.81	11.967	1.157		some of them are still stuck together	
93	24	12.001	13.311	1.31	Yeah. We gotta- don't cheat.		
93	24	13.495	15.595	2.1		I already know where this goes	
93	24	16.316	16.821	0.505	we do?		
93	24	19.68	21.301	1.621	Here look at the flat edges		
93	24	27.308	27.755	0.447		here	
93	24	27.512	30.423	2.911	I don't remember where they all went		
93	24	29.444	29.886	0.442		aah!	
93	24	31.918	32.754	0.836		maybe not	
93	24	33.096	34.954	1.858	Let's find all the flat edges first		
93	24	35.201	36.385	1.184		oh here's a flat edge!	
93	24	36.553	37.953	1.4	okay so put it along the edge		
93	24	37.508	38.682	1.174		here's a flat edge	
93	24	38.797	39.992	1.195	here's a corner		
93	24	40.733	41.817	1.084		*gasp* a corner!	
93	24	41.567	43.309	1.742	I don't know if it's top or bottom though		
93	24	43.051	44.23	1.179		Yeah, look!	
93	24	43.695	46.369	2.674	I know, but it might go down here so we'll have to wait and see		
93	24	47.812	48.664	0.852	here's one		
93	24	51.499	53.141	1.642	and here's one		
93	24	55.717	56.859	1.142	here's another corner		
93	24	59.567	60.919	1.352	Let's do the flat ones, honey		
93	24	61.14	62.693	1.553		down, here!	
93	24	61.292	62.787	1.495	Then we'll do the inside		
93	24	63.125	63.757	0.632		yeah!	
93	24	63.601	64.512	0.911	Well look		
93	24	71.069	72.132	1.063	Good job		
93	24	72.271	72.986	0.715	alright		
93	24	73.114	73.588	0.474		oh!	
93	24	75.124	77.335	2.211	That's not flat. Let's look for flat.

94	48	536.476	536.887	0.411	good		
94	48	537.108	539.385	2.277	Now we have to find		
94	48	540.535	542.158	1.623	the color that will match this		
94	48	542.277	543.845	1.568		Will match this?	
94	48	543.658	546.411	2.753	That doesn't match the color so why would you put it there, right?		
94	48	547.095	548.281	1.186		he match

94	48	553.045	554.504	1.459	Let's look over here		
94	48	554.782	557.955	3.173	Now, let's find the ones with the edges		
94	48	559.033	560.152	1.119	No. You see?		
94	48	560.407	567.423	7.016	This is a shape that goes out so we need to find a shape that we can put that one inside of it. That's that's the wrong color		
94	48	568.587	570.332	1.745	Maybe this one? Try this one!		
94	48	575.148	578.693	3.545	huh-uh the edge has to be on the edge. Edge on the edge.		
94	48	578.97	583.493	4.523	See it's not gonna work because the edge isn't on the edge. See the straight edge has to be on that edge. 		
94	48	584.541	586.045	1.504	Okay? Try		
94	48	587.667	590.254	2.587	No no no. See? See what you are trying to do?		
94	48	590.661	593.697	3.036	You have the circle on the edge. That's not gonna work		
94	48	594.677	595.046	0.369	here		
94	48	596.619	597.007	0.388	okay?

94	48	606.052	608.481	2.429	Where is the piece? Does it fit?		
94	48	609.001	610.408	1.407	No. That doesn't fit		
94	48	610.593	613.488	2.895	So once we, once we know it doesn't fit-		
94	48	614.533	616.009	1.476	We get another one		
94	48	616.275	619.643	3.368	That one didn't work. That one didn't work.		
94	48	620.349	622.086	1.737	Let's try another one.		
94	48	627.697	630.415	2.718	No because the edge. You're not listening.		
94	48	630.568	632.239	1.671	The edge has to be straight		
94	48	632.56	636.047	3.487	See how those are straight? A line		
94	48	636.605	638.699	2.094	We have to make a line that goes on that part		
94	48	640.087	641.541	1.454	So let's find the other piece		
94	48	643.625	644.775	1.15	Is it here?

97	48	635.767	638.237	2.47	Umm, this piece maybe could rearrange.		
97	48	638.512	641.022	2.51	Maybe that flat edge goes on a different flat edge.		
97	48	644.947	649.197	4.25	So how does a corner piece have t-, have to fit in to fit in the corner?

97	48	698.717	704.067	5.35	Umm, let's put all the pieces to the puzz- the butterfly pieces together.  See if you can find where they go.		
97	48	712.979	713.566	0.587		Umm.	
97	48	725.702	727.597	1.895	You see that flat edge?		
97	48	728.173	728.417	0.244		Yeah.	
97	48	728.58	731.045	2.465	Where does the flat edge have to go?

97	48	738.984	741.036	2.052	I think you got that middle part right.		
97	48	745.207	746.202	0.995	Mm-hmm.		
97	48	747.309	749.39	2.081	Look at this flat edge here.

97	48	767.512	771.029	3.517	What do you want to work on next? Maybe this, umm, cheetah?		
97	48	771.044	771.276	0.232		Yeah.	
97	48	771.288	776.154	4.866	Okay, well. I'll help you get all of the cheetah pieces in one place.		
97	48	777.329	780.504	3.175	And then, let's see if we can find where they go.		
97	48	786.34	787.596	1.256	Only one.		
97	48	787.625	788.09	0.465		Only.	
97	48	789.119	790.415	1.296	I think you found it.		
97	48	790.43	790.668	0.238		Only.	
97	48	790.91	792.026	1.116	It's the other eye.		
97	48	810.444	812.461	2.017	That's a good idea.  Mm-hmm.		
97	48	813.237	814.214	0.977		Help me.	
97	48	817.366	819.279	1.913	I think that's a good guess.		
97	48	819.311	820.45	1.139	Where could that go?		
97	48	825.213	825.719	0.506	Yep.		
97	48	828.497	831.323	2.826	Now the big snake is coming into view.		
97	48	832.445	834.41	1.965	Is he like a boa constrictor?		
97	48	836.683	838.049	1.366	What do you want to work on next?		
97	48	840.244	841.663	1.419		A snake.	
97	48	841.715	843.407	1.692	A snake? Okay.

97	48	849.503	850.404	0.901	And this too.		
97	48	860.505	863.22	2.715	I wonder if that might be part of his eye.		
97	48	861.714	861.935	0.221		Mom	
97	48	863.926	864.223	0.297		Wha-

97	48	903.539	906.045	2.506		C-could be this.	
97	48	906.048	906.536	0.488	Yeah!		
97	48	907.618	908.432	0.814	Sure could!		
97	48	910.36	913.354	2.994	Okay, is there something else with some mushrooms?		
97	48	913.846	916.043	2.197	What about this one?		
97	48	918.886	919.514	0.628	Yeah.		
97	48	919.834	923.165	3.331	And now, do you remember what animal this was? What insect?

97	48	998.229	1002.694	4.465	I think I see, I saw some part of the ant on that piece.  Like some ant legs.		
97	48	1003.531	1005.019	1.488	Think you could get that?		
97	48	1005.072	1008.432	3.36		Does, are these ants?	
97	48	1008.462	1011.049	2.587	Oh, not on that piece but, umm.

97	48	1014.279	1015.675	1.396	These look like ant legs.		
97	48	1015.977	1016.256	0.279		No.	
97	48	1016.401	1016.669	0.268	No.

97	48	1055.503	1058.084	2.581	What does that look like it could be part of?		
97	48	1058.09	1060.078	1.988		That's a h-eye.	
97	48	1060.09	1063.148	3.058	An eye? It's round like an eye.		
97	48	1064.004	1066.568	2.564	I wonder if, it kind of looks like some fruit to me.		
97	48	1067.565	1068.03	0.465	Umm-		
97	48	1069.71	1072.088	2.378	What do you think about these pieces?

97	48	1094.3	1094.753	0.453	Okay.		
97	48	1096.282	1098.009	1.727	Is it on something?		
97	48	1098.727	1101.419	2.692	It's a little warped.  It doesn't lie flat.		
97	48	1102.416	1102.963	0.547	Okay.		
97	48	1103.509	1104.05	0.541	Umm.		
97	48	1104.808	1108.128	3.32	Where do you think that piece could go?		
97	48	1108.271	1108.945	0.674	Good.		
97	48	1111.681	1115.088	3.407	Do you see some, another puzzle piece with some of that pink flower?		
97	48	1116.989	1117.745	0.756	Mm-hmm.

97	48	1169.134	1171.454	2.32	I wonder if that could be connected.

97	48	1191.325	1193.075	1.75	What do you think about this piece?		
97	48	1195.282	1196.514	1.232		Where does this goes?	
97	48	1196.532	1198.218	1.686	Maybe along the edge.

97	48	1208.75	1211.511	2.761	But the flat side has to be along the edge.		
97	48	1212.357	1213.514	1.157	Does that fit?		
97	48	1213.813	1214.15	0.337		Yeah.	
97	48	1213.824	1214.853	1.029	What do you know.

97	48	1229.44	1230.824	1.384	It's like part of a bird.		
97	48	1231.615	1232.057	0.442	Yep.		
97	48	1233.871	1235.249	1.378	Like a toucan.

101	24	113.215	115.425	2.21	*singing*		
101	24	116.15	121.2	5.05	Ooh, nice!  We're kind of violating mommy's rules of doing the edges first, aren't we?		
101	24	122.025	123.505	1.48	Mmkay, nice!		
101	24	123.675	124.405	0.73	Let's see.		
101	24	124.43	126.98	2.55		That's actually not an octopus!	
101	24	127.015	129.355	2.34	Oh, you're right!  That's surprising!		
101	24	127.645	128.415	0.77		*laughing*	
101	24	129.37	131.98	2.61	I completely thought it was too.		
101	24	132.435	133.135	0.7		*laughing*	
101	24	133.585	136.475	2.89	Umm, what is over here? I don't know.		
101	24	136.49	139.05	2.56		Umm, a whale or a shark.	
101	24	138.0	141.04	3.04	You know, maybe we should do our corners.  What do you think?		
101	24	141.06	141.38	0.32		Okay.	
101	24	143.36	146.28	2.92		This corner piece I think goes there.	
101	24	146.35	147.52	1.17	Hmm, what about this one?		
101	24	153.735	154.185	0.45	Nice.		
101	24	154.83	156.57	1.74	And one last corner piece, here.		
101	24	160.02	162.3	2.28		That one must go here.	
101	24	162.394	164.046	1.652	Hmm, interesting.		
101	24	166.034	167.656	1.622	*laughing* Silly goose.		
101	24	168.835	172.23	3.395	Since we don't know the puzzle very well, maybe we should try to fill in the pieces we can tell.		
101	24	172.247	175.032	2.785	For instance, what's going to have to go here.		
101	24	175.546	176.413	0.867		Crab piece.	
101	24	176.439	179.008	2.569	Crab piece.  Do you see a crab piece? You got it.		
101	24	180.165	180.828	0.663		*laughing*	
101	24	180.834	181.409	0.575	*laughing*		
101	24	182.482	184.778	2.296		I like this game you're playing with me.	
101	24	184.793	188.369	3.576	I like this game too because I like playing puzzles with you.		
101	24	189.0	190.477	1.477	Umm, what do you see up here?		
101	24	191.982	193.326	1.344		Umm, a whale.	
101	24	196.613	198.043	1.43	Do you think that's going to go there?		
101	24	198.584	199.282	0.698		Yeah.	
101	24	199.393	200.055	0.662		It might.	
101	24	201.166	201.899	0.733		Nope, it doesn't.	
101	24	202.178	202.846	0.668	Look.		
101	24	203.96	204.443	0.483	Blue.		
101	24	205.992	207.201	1.209	*noises*		
101	24	207.207	208.358	1.151		*noises*	
101	24	208.375	211.893	3.518	You know what i'm starting to think? I think that this corner might go over there and that corner might go over here.		
101	24	213.287	214.996	1.709		Aah, that must be true.	
101	24	215.583	217.537	1.954	You, why do you think I think that?		
101	24	218.071	222.891	4.82		Because this looks like that.	
101	24	222.919	226.221	3.302	Exactly.  So I think now maybe we could try to fill that in.  What do you think?		
101	24	226.751	227.094	0.343		Okay.	
101	24	233.323	234.003	0.68	Nice!		
101	24	235.274	237.611	2.337	What else could go over there?		
101	24	237.686	238.303	0.617		Umm.	
101	24	238.413	240.297	1.884	You wanna try that one?		
101	24	240.315	241.251	0.936	That's a good call.		
101	24	242.702	243.452	0.75	Try it out.		
101	24	243.496	245.083	1.587	Kind of a funny piece, isn't it?		
101	24	245.429	248.109	2.68		No, it doesn't go where I thought.	
101	24	249.013	252.135	3.122	Do you know what i'm noticing? Aah, can I see it again?		
101	24	252.272	255.736	3.464	Aah, yeah I don't know about that one, but you know what I see over here?		
101	24	255.876	258.737	2.861		Oh, yeah, that ### octopus.	
101	24	258.748	261.039	2.291	Let's try to do that, maybe.  What do you think?		
101	24	262.641	263.03	0.389	Do it.		
101	24	263.068	264.498	1.43		*laughing*	
101	24	263.684	265.103	1.419	Let's do it.		
101	24	268.091	269.672	1.581	Mmkay, do you see any more?		
101	24	274.794	278.067	3.273	Connection, connection, nice.		
101	24	279.965	280.657	0.692	Any others?		
101	24	281.712	282.515	0.803		Umm.	
101	24	284.166	284.631	0.465		There	
101	24	284.916	285.363	0.447		Aah	
101	24	287.994	288.744	0.75	*noises*		
101	24	289.067	291.393	2.326	The orange kind of jumps out at you, doesn't it?		
101	24	291.579	292.48	0.901		Yeah *laughing*	
101	24	292.896	293.494	0.598	Nice!		
101	24	294.003	294.562	0.559	Now.		
101	24	295.526	297.154	1.628	Look at this guy.		
101	24	299.073	299.625	0.552		Oh!	
101	24	299.669	300.913	1.244	*laughing*		
101	24	301.716	309.076	7.36	Nice. And let's, you know, we don't have too many edges left.  Maybe we should separate the edges from the middles at this point.		
101	24	310.34	311.479	1.139	And that might help us.		
101	24	311.799	314.066	2.267	So these guys have to be on the edge.		
101	24	316.176	316.781	0.605	Oop!		
101	24	317.246	319.205	1.959	I think you had it! I think you had it!		
101	24	319.964	320.58	0.616		It goes here?	
101	24	320.604	323.127	2.523	What do you think? 'Cause see how those go together?		
101	24	323.958	324.493	0.535		Yeah.	
101	24	324.504	324.847	0.343	Nice.		
101	24	324.937	326.076	1.139	Alright, what's next?		
101	24	328.12	333.144	5.024	Ooh!  A little jellyfish!  Nice!		
101	24	333.186	335.767	2.581		Oh yeah, I didn't know it was a jell.	
101	24	335.779	336.052	0.273	Jell.		
101	24	336.521	337.207	0.686	What's next?		
101	24	338.155	341.097	2.942	*noises*		
101	24	341.109	342.557	1.448		*laughing*	
101	24	346.014	346.484	0.47	Nice!		
101	24	348.877	349.54	0.663		*laughing* No!	
101	24	349.569	350.086	0.517	*laughing*		
101	24	350.42	352.356	1.936	Alright, what about these guys?		
101	24	353.189	354.596	1.407		Mmm.	
101	24	355.046	357.023	1.977	You still have lunch all over your face.		
101	24	357.046	358.238	1.192	You silly girl.		
101	24	359.991	360.456	0.465	Nice!		
101	24	360.491	361.502	1.011		*laughing*	
101	24	361.624	364.584	2.96		*laughing*	
101	24	364.616	367.61	2.994	Come on, let's be serious!  This is serious business!		
101	24	367.631	368.369	0.738		*laughing*	
101	24	371.889	374.424	2.535	Now it's just easy-peasy.		
101	24	376.226	377.29	1.064	Yes!		
101	24	380.235	381.188	0.953	Yes!		
101	24	383.328	384.368	1.04	And this funny one.		
101	24	384.779	385.395	0.616			24 piece ends
101	48	425.333	426.17	0.837			48 piece starts
101	48	429.542	430.554	1.012	Climb up there.		
101	48	429.704	430.436	0.732			Experimenter exits
101	48	430.56	430.891	0.331		What?	
101	48	430.894	431.719	0.825	I know!		
101	48	433.04	437.133	4.093	Let's take a look at it before we dump it, so we don't make the same mistake we did before!		
101	48	437.54	437.941	0.401		Yeah.	
101	48	439.438	441.118	1.68	That is a cool looking puzzle, isn't it?		
101	48	441.871	442.243	0.372		Yeah.	
101	48	441.889	442.674	0.785	You ready?		
101	48	442.677	442.973	0.296		Yes!	
101	48	442.988	443.808	0.82	You want to do the dump?		
101	48	445.045	449.731	4.686	*noises*		
101	48	450.512	452.68	2.168	*noises*	*noises*	
101	48	457.008	459.037	2.029	We don't want to cheat, right?		
101	48	459.057	462.046	2.989	We gotta make sure they're all, ooh, this is going to be a hard puzzle!		
101	48	462.144	464.755	2.611		Yeah, I already know where that one goes.	
101	48	464.641	464.903	0.262	Oh, nice!		
101	48	464.935	467.046	2.111	Should we maybe find the corners first?		
101	48	467.995	471.751	3.756	I'm going to separate the edges and the corners.  I mean the edges and the middles, okay?		
101	48	473.476	475.848	2.372	And then you start to try to fill in the edges.		
101	48	476.152	481.001	4.849		*noises*	
101	48	481.066	484.072	3.006	Hey you, you're not an edge piece!  Get over there!		
101	48	484.078	487.055	2.977		*laughing*	
101	48	484.563	486.407	1.844	You don't belong over there!		
101	48	487.462	489.276	1.814	Hey, you! Get over there!		
101	48	489.3	493.317	4.017		*laughing*	
101	48	493.442	496.029	2.587	You are a silly goose.		
101	48	496.026	498.084	2.058		*laughing*	
101	48	498.702	499.522	0.82	Aah, corner!		
101	48	499.63	503.63	4.0	Look, here are the corners.  I'll put them in a special place.		
101	48	510.351	512.804	2.453		There are three!	
101	48	515.048	516.147	1.099	Oh look.		
101	48	517.516	519.644	2.128	Yes, yes and look what I have here!

101	48	530.22	532.313	2.093	You're not an edge piece!  Get outta here!		
101	48	532.33	533.766	1.436		*laughing*	
101	48	534.49	535.508	1.018	Is this an edge piece?		
101	48	535.592	536.464	0.872		Umm, yes!	
101	48	536.557	538.197	1.64	Okay, then you can stay.		
101	48	538.273	539.435	1.162	What about this one?		
101	48	540.505	541.546	1.041		Mmm, yes.	
101	48	541.566	543.025	1.459	Alright, then you can stay.		
101	48	541.853	545.022	3.169		Hey!  Why are you putting them there and there?	
101	48	545.05	546.067	1.017	These are all the edges.		
101	48	547.927	551.026	3.099	And these are all the middles.  We'll do those after.		
101	48	551.796	552.197	0.401	Right?		
101	48	553.81	554.81	1.0	That's how we do.		
101	48	555.398	557.938	2.54	What in the what is going on here?		
101	48	559.099	559.378	0.279		Oops.	
101	48	560.285	560.796	0.511	Oops.		
101	48	561.372	562.663	1.291		I thought it would be up in the air.	
101	48	563.139	564.272	1.133	Aah!		
101	48	564.293	565.345	1.052		Can you go get that?	
101	48	565.441	566.308	0.867	Yes I can.		
101	48	570.006	571.867	1.861		I like playing one of the games.	
101	48	571.855	573.006	1.151	Aww geez!		
101	48	573.023	576.605	3.582		Jesus you guys!  Come back up here and stay!	
101	48	576.611	577.175	0.564	*laughing*		
101	48	577.196	577.574	0.378	NAME		
101	48	577.583	578.688	1.105	*laughing*		
101	48	577.668	578.773	1.105		*laughing*	
101	48	578.761	580.377	1.616	Are you doing this on purpose now?		
101	48	580.395	582.343	1.948		They just fly away!	
101	48	582.358	584.253	1.895	Okay.  Oh, 'cause it's a butterfly?		
101	48	584.561	585.329	0.768		Yeah.	
101	48	585.364	586.457	1.093	A hair here.  Okay.		
101	48	588.428	589.713	1.285	Wacky pieces.		
101	48	590.873	594.001	3.128	Hmm, I see something strange going on here.		
101	48	594.013	594.833	0.82		What?	
101	48	594.865	596.993	2.128	Well, look, I think you're right about that piece.		
101	48	596.894	597.412	0.518		*laughing*	
101	48	597.432	599.845	2.413	Put that one there, I think you were right about that.		
101	48	599.941	603.673	3.732	And I think this one is gonna be going up the side.		
101	48	604.29	604.889	0.599		Oh!	
101	48	605.264	606.38	1.116	Ah-hah-hah-hah.		
101	48	607.514	608.34	0.826		Oh.	
101	48	608.346	610.003	1.657	Look at that.		
101	48	610.587	612.75	2.163		Yeah, I think you might be right.	
101	48	612.744	613.064	0.32	Now.		
101	48	613.88	618.06	4.18	Look at this. This one's a corner, and clearly it has to go in this way, right?		
101	48	618.092	618.406	0.314		Yeah.	
101	48	618.424	620.302	1.878	So which corner is that one going to go in?		
101	48	620.666	621.514	0.848		*laughing*	
101	48	621.526	621.776	0.25	Yeah.		
101	48	622.512	625.006	2.494	And this one is a little bit harder to tell.		
101	48	625.05	627.579	2.529	I don't know if this one goes up there.  Do you think it does?		
101	48	628.814	629.512	0.698		Aah.	
101	48	629.518	630.919	1.401	I just don't remember.		
101	48	631.864	635.131	3.267	But look, there's lots of these pieces that match up with that one.		
101	48	635.184	638.672	3.488	Maybe we should try to figure out, well, I don't know.  What do you want to do next?		
101	48	639.201	640.882	1.681		I might just put that there.	
101	48	640.925	642.431	1.506		No, it doesn't work.	
101	48	642.498	644.766	2.268	It does work!  Does!		
101	48	645.394	646.725	1.331		No, that doesn't seem right!	
101	48	646.757	648.385	1.628	Well look.  Here, look at this.		
101	48	649.228	651.374	2.146	These flowers surely match up with this one.		
101	48	651.557	652.476	0.919	Try it.		
101	48	656.895	658.494	1.599	Hmm, interesting.		
101	48	660.037	661.805	1.768	I think you might be right, actually.		
101	48	663.415	663.828	0.413		*laughing*	
101	48	663.656	665.511	1.855	Do you think this might go like this?		
101	48	666.217	666.682	0.465		Yeah.	
101	48	666.705	669.077	2.372	Ooh, and then this one would go down here like this?		
101	48	669.147	669.508	0.361		Yeah.	
101	48	669.525	671.519	1.994	*gasp* Let's keep try-ooh.		
101	48	671.54	673.389	1.849	Is there any, no, that one's not going to connect.		
101	48	673.435	676.011	2.576	This might go somewhere else though. I don't know where that goes.		
101	48	676.774	680.274	3.5		Well, it is an edge piece.	
101	48	680.321	681.722	1.401	Yeah, it is but-		
101	48	681.481	682.707	1.226		It might just have to-	
101	48	682.519	684.158	1.639	Or it could go along the top, or-		
101	48	684.21	685.053	0.843	Over there.		
101	48	685.614	686.73	1.116	We'll have to wait and see.	Aah, it might just-	
101	48	687.504	690.207	2.703	Alright, let's go with this.		
101	48	691.105	693.123	2.018	Hypothesis.  Hmm.		
101	48	693.358	694.638	1.28	Oh, look, but here-		
101	48	694.777	697.562	2.785	Here's some more funny little hands on a branch.		
101	48	699.262	699.663	0.401		Ooh!	
101	48	699.959	701.459	1.5	Like these guys.		
101	48	702.308	704.779	2.471	Aha!  Interesting.		
101	48	707.911	711.103	3.192	And now, Hello? Are you paying attention?		
101	48	711.118	712.385	1.267		*laughing*	
101	48	712.949	714.716	1.767	Aah, what do you think this is?		
101	48	716.234	716.723	0.489		Hmm.	
101	48	718.98	719.363	0.383	Nice!		
101	48	720.927	723.532	2.605	Good spot, good spot my friend.		
101	48	724.59	725.107	0.517	Alright.		
101	48	725.319	727.703	2.384	Oh, what do you think that is?		
101	48	728.489	732.216	3.727	Yeah!  Oh, it's starting to come together now!		
101	48	732.893	735.114	2.221	Oh yeah, oh yeah!		
101	48	737.474	738.172	0.698	Alright.		
101	48	738.219	739.602	1.383	What next?		
101	48	741.794	743.3	1.506	I don't know what that is.		
101	48	743.582	744.995	1.413	Oh, but you know what I notice?		
101	48	745.003	745.748	0.745		What?	
101	48	745.765	747.323	1.558	Look at the colors on that one.		
101	48	747.8	748.713	0.913		What?	
101	48	749.599	751.076	1.477	What colors do you see here?		
101	48	751.099	754.093	2.994		Orange and green.	
101	48	754.178	755.66	1.482	And what color is-		
101	48	756.995	759.646	2.651		Oh, cool, yeah!  You made it.	
101	48	760.035	761.158	1.123		There's a match.	
101	48	761.291	763.698	2.407	Let's see if it actually works.		
101	48	763.756	764.332	0.576		Yes.	
101	48	764.352	765.957	1.605	Yes!		
101	48	766.073	766.898	0.825	Sweet!		
101	48	767.016	771.673	4.657	Oh, here's some more.  But that doesn't seem to go in the same place, does it?		
101	48	771.792	772.693	0.901		Watch this.	
101	48	772.795	774.789	1.994	*gasp* Watch what?		
101	48	774.798	776.007	1.209		*laughing*	
101	48	775.49	776.106	0.616	*laughing*		
101	48	777.473	778.38	0.907	Oh, you know what?		
101	48	778.548	778.932	0.384	Mmm.		
101	48	779.781	780.415	0.634		What?	
101	48	780.97	781.418	0.448	Well-		
101	48	782.002	786.043	4.041	I'm not sure where that one goes, maybe we should wait on that one, but I do notice some mushrooms.		
101	48	787.249	787.836	0.587		Ooh!	
101	48	787.885	788.897	1.012	Ooh!		
101	48	793.894	795.841	1.947	Did I get all of the edge pieces?		
101	48	796.321	796.728	0.407	Hmm.		
101	48	796.798	797.402	0.604		Hey!	
101	48	797.362	797.664	0.302	What?		
101	48	798.653	799.194	0.541		Butterfly.	
101	48	799.208	800.307	1.099	Ooh, you want to put that in?		
101	48	800.688	801.6	0.912		No, that's for later.	
101	48	801.633	802.121	0.488	Okay.		
101	48	802.139	805.237	3.098		I just can make, save it for later. But you interrupted.	
101	48	805.781	806.77	0.989	Oh, i'm so sorry!		
101	48	810.903	811.252	0.349		No.	
101	48	811.496	811.868	0.372	Look.		
101	48	812.473	812.979	0.506		What?	
101	48	815.691	816.052	0.361		Oh!	
101	48	816.47	817.057	0.587	What?		
101	48	818.054	819.252	1.198	What do you see on this piece?		
101	48	821.025	821.711	0.686		Oh.	
101	48	823.485	823.985	0.5		Hmm.	
101	48	824.956	825.683	0.727		I don't know.	
101	48	825.831	826.761	0.93	Look at the piece.		
101	48	827.395	828.663	1.268	What's this over here?		
101	48	828.779	830.012	1.233		Oh, mushroom.	
101	48	830.035	830.587	0.552	*laughing*		
101	48	830.59	831.253	0.663		*laughing*	
101	48	831.34	832.072	0.732	Goofball.		
101	48	832.276	832.817	0.541	Oh!	Oh!	
101	48	833.436	834.267	0.831	What are those?		
101	48	834.752	835.601	0.849		Funny little legs.	
101	48	835.717	839.972	4.255	Funny little legs.  Do you see any o- funny other funny little legs on an edge piece?		
101	48	841.863	842.822	0.959		Funny little legs.	
101	48	842.842	846.802	3.96	Nice! Do you see any other funny little legs on an edge piece?		
101	48	847.921	848.258	0.337		No.	
101	48	851.02	851.927	0.907		Oh yeah.	
101	48	851.927	853.712	1.785	What do you think those funny little legs belong to?		
101	48	855.029	855.633	0.604		I wonder.	
101	48	857.291	858.581	1.29	Okay, now what?		
101	48	859.936	860.669	0.733		Aha!	
101	48	860.733	861.244	0.511	Aha!		
101	48	861.302	861.889	0.587		The ants.	
101	48	862.421	863.63	1.209	Yeah I think you're right.		
101	48	865.136	866.368	1.232	Where do you think that one's going to go?		
101	48	866.601	867.217	0.616		Hmm.	
101	48	869.747	871.979	2.232	*noises* *laughing*	*laughing*	
101	48	873.898	875.294	1.396	Try it somewhere else maybe.		
101	48	877.579	879.614	2.035	Mmm, you just tried it there!		
101	48	879.631	881.986	2.355		*laughing*	
101	48	883.122	884.186	1.064		Ooh!	
101	48	883.474	884.195	0.721	Ooh!		
101	48	884.712	885.247	0.535	Wait!		
101	48	885.293	887.473	2.18	Why didn't you try it there?  I liked it there!		
101	48	887.872	889.453	1.581	No, oh.  Wrong.		
101	48	890.675	891.797	1.122	What about-		
101	48	893.614	894.562	0.948	What about-		
101	48	895.234	895.897	0.663	*noises*		
101	48	895.926	896.583	0.657		*laughing*	
101	48	897.06	898.211	1.151		No, it doesn't work.	
101	48	898.473	899.363	0.89		###	
101	48	899.339	900.077	0.738	Yay!		
101	48	900.121	901.511	1.39		*laughing*	
101	48	902.302	903.052	0.75	Alright.		
101	48	903.294	904.235	0.941	What's next?		
101	48	904.375	905.357	0.982	I feel like we're missing.		
101	48	906.961	908.984	2.023	No, I guess those are all the edge pieces.		
101	48	909.019	913.168	4.149	I just don't see how they're going to g- oh, nice spot!		
101	48	914.487	916.415	1.928		No, that one's for last.	
101	48	917.021	919.05	2.029	That one is a very strange one.		
101	48	919.733	921.227	1.494	Oh, you know what?		
101	48	921.445	923.672	2.227	I think we made a mistake.		
101	48	924.087	924.582	0.495		What?	
101	48	925.131	925.666	0.535	Well		
101	48	927.131	927.869	0.738	I'll show you in a minute.		
101	48	927.913	930.401	2.488	That also means that there must be another-		
101	48	930.855	931.733	0.878	Oh, I see.		
101	48	931.829	933.55	1.721	Look at.  Look at what we did over here.		
101	48	934.66	935.37	0.71		What?	
101	48	935.376	938.225	2.849	So this looks like it kind of connects but look.		
101	48	938.236	940.975	2.739	This doesn't.  And this doesn't.		
101	48	942.14	943.204	1.064	*laughing*	*laughing*	
101	48	943.248	944.486	1.238	You know what? I think-		
101	48	944.507	945.914	1.407		*laughing*	
101	48	945.896	947.803	1.907	We gotta move this guy down.		
101	48	947.814	948.274	0.46		*laughing*	
101	48	948.288	950.027	1.739	*noises*		
101	48	949.361	950.018	0.657		*noises*	
101	48	950.079	950.945	0.866		*laughing*	
101	48	950.977	953.076	2.099	Alright.  What are you doing with the frog?		
101	48	953.079	955.148	2.069		*laughing*	
101	48	955.171	956.247	1.076	Oh my god.		
101	48	956.209	956.785	0.576		*laughing*	
101	48	956.788	958.579	1.791	Alright, two more edge pieces. Come on!		
101	48	959.358	961.131	1.773	Let's do this! Let's do this!		
101	48	961.128	962.204	1.076		*laughing*	
101	48	966.796	967.191	0.395	Nice!		
101	48	967.697	968.656	0.959	And that means.		
101	48	971.676	972.275	0.599	Yay!		
101	48	972.807	973.551	0.744	Alright!		
101	48	973.807	974.778	0.971	*noises*		
101	48	975.624	977.327	1.703		Here are all of them.	
101	48	977.336	978.789	1.453	What do you want to start with?		
101	48	978.824	979.539	0.715	Of course.		
101	48	980.303	982.542	2.239	Of course the butterfly.		
101	48	983.568	984.248	0.68	Nice.		
101	48	984.519	988.426	3.907	That blue certainly stands out and makes it easy to find the butterfly pieces, doesn't it?		
101	48	990.485	992.822	2.337		Yeah, I'm only needing to find some blue.	
101	48	994.549	994.909	0.36		Oof!	
101	48	994.915	995.473	0.558	Oof!		
101	48	999.307	1001.685	2.378	Do you think oof is the favorite word in our family?		
101	48	1001.735	1002.281	0.546		*laughing*	
101	48	1002.305	1003.409	1.104	*laughing*		
101	48	1003.549	1004.253	0.704		Why?	
101	48	1004.587	1006.436	1.849	Because we all say oof a lot.		
101	48	1008.11	1010.104	1.994		Huh, how does this work?	
101	48	1010.317	1012.491	2.174	I think you got it.  Oh, so close!		
101	48	1012.678	1013.509	0.831	No.		
101	48	1013.587	1014.739	1.152		How do we?	
101	48	1014.803	1016.03	1.227	You had it.		
101	48	1016.108	1017.219	1.111	Keep turning it.		
101	48	1017.913	1018.623	0.71		Here?	
101	48	1018.181	1020.071	1.89	*noises*  Look.		
101	48	1020.277	1021.4	1.123	Put it over here.		
101	48	1021.449	1026.022	4.573	And then turn it.  Slide it, slide it, no, you had it, you had it, you had it.		
101	48	1026.34	1028.055	1.715	Slide it on in there.		
101	48	1029.883	1030.5	0.617		*laughing*	
101	48	1032.401	1033.761	1.36	*noises*		
101	48	1034.666	1035.439	0.773		*laughing*	
101	48	1035.43	1035.738	0.308	Yes!		
101	48	1035.767	1037.814	2.047		*laughing*	
101	48	1037.814	1040.238	2.424	Look at this cutie-patootie.  What do you think that is?		
101	48	1041.427	1042.648	1.221		Mmm, I don't know.

101	48	1062.831	1065.313	2.482	I'm not sure he goes with that other frog.		
101	48	1065.851	1068.415	2.564	You know there's this, umm, what is this animal?

101	48	1173.889	1175.284	1.395	It's not an alligator.		
101	48	1176.005	1177.22	1.215		It's a crocodile.	
101	48	1177.24	1178.665	1.425	It's a snake!

101	48	1187.063	1188.225	1.162	You can do something else first.		
101	48	1191.29	1192.092	0.802		A peacock.

101	48	1227.638	1228.115	0.477		Yeah.	
101	48	1228.202	1229.4	1.198	How about, look at these.

101	48	1240.968	1242.747	1.779		I didn't know it would be like this.	
101	48	1242.753	1243.212	0.459	I know!		
101	48	1243.215	1244.57	1.355		I thought it would be in the play room.

102	24	5.33	8.48	3.15		First we have to take all of the pieces out.	
102	24	5.69	6.47	0.78			experimenter leaves
102	24	8.6	12.02	3.42	Ok, do you want to take them out one at a time or turn it over and dump them all out together. 		
102	24	13.675	16.295	2.62		Take it out one at a time.	
102	24	16.15	18.8	2.65	Ok, you start over there and I'll start over here.		
102	24	23.52	25.86	2.34	So what kind of puzzles did you do in the other room.

102	24	46.98	48.48	1.5	Alright, let's mix 'em up.		
102	24	52.69	57.03	4.34		Because we don't want to know where the pieces go.	
102	24	57.135	58.085	0.95	That's right.		
102	24	58.465	59.515	1.05	Alright, are we all set?

102	24	77.966	81.399	3.433		Yeah. I had a star fish.	
102	24	81.403	83.961	2.558	Cool, should we look for the other corner pieces, too?		
102	24	84.436	85.403	0.967		Yeah.	
102	24	87.332	88.023	0.691	Hmm.		
102	24	87.723	90.006	2.283		I found a side one.	
102	24	89.893	91.793	1.9	Which side do you think that goes on?		
102	24	92.222	94.814	2.592		Maybe here. No.	
102	24	94.747	96.631	1.884	Well, what if we leave it there.		
102	24	96.652	100.71	4.058	'Cause I think you're right, it goes on that side, but there might be another piece there first.		
102	24	103.535	104.469	0.934	Mmm.		
102	24	104.781	105.506	0.725		Hmm.	
102	24	105.714	107.839	2.125	Here's a piece with a flat edge.		
102	24	108.539	112.255	3.716	And I think that's right side up, so I bet this goes along the top.		
102	24	118.109	119.767	1.658	Oh, do you see another corner piece?		
102	24	122.084	125.484	3.4		Oh yeah. A shark corner piece.

102	24	183.355	184.011	0.656	Good job.		
102	24	184.569	185.589	1.02		Wow.

102	24	201.564	204.35	2.786		It's a side piece.	
102	24	204.376	207.045	2.669	It's a side piece? Why don't we try putting it on the side?		
102	24	207.551	208.622	1.071		Ok.	
102	24	212.7	215.633	2.933		It goes on this side.	
102	24	215.577	218.852	3.275	Cool! Can you find one more side piece that has some orange octopus?		
102	24	219.914	222.53	2.616		Orange octopus.	
102	24	223.67	224.408	0.738		Hmm.	
102	24	228.791	231.377	2.586	No, that's something else orange it looks like.		
102	24	232.892	234.227	1.335	Look over on your right side.		
102	24	241.519	242.305	0.786	Nice job.		
102	24	244.049	245.531	1.482	What should we work on next?		
102	24	247.122	247.744	0.622	That one?		
102	24	248.125	248.991	0.866		Yeah.	
102	24	250.128	253.329	3.201		I bet, I guess this one goes here.	
102	24	253.364	253.852	0.488	Oh.		
102	24	253.365	254.042	0.677		Nope.	
102	24	253.964	254.781	0.817	Let's look at it.		
102	24	255.692	256.82	1.128	What do you see about those?		
102	24	258.179	259.033	0.854	Are those straight?		
102	24	259.542	260.627	1.085		No.	
102	24	261.172	261.818	0.646	No?		
102	24	262.065	263.754	1.689		They're corners.	
102	24	263.271	264.357	1.086	They're corners?		
102	24	264.365	265.536	1.171	Where do corner pieces go?		
102	24	265.831	266.471	0.64		Here.	
102	24	266.642	267.574	0.932	Good job.		
102	24	268.714	269.531	0.817	I bet there's		
102	24	269.186	271.649	2.463		Can I have another one of yours?	
102	24	271.542	274.145	2.603	Yeah, you can have whichever one's you want, sweetie.		
102	24	274.12	275.047	0.927		This one.	
102	24	274.982	276.964	1.982	Alright, thank you for asking and being polite.		
102	24	278.677	280.646	1.969	Oh, is that an edge piece?		
102	24	282.022	282.614	0.592		No.	
102	24	283.016	285.89	2.874	Then if it's not an edge piece where does it probably go?		
102	24	288.131	289.487	1.356	Oh, there's an edge piece.		
102	24	291.741	295.229	3.488		It probably goes the other way.	
102	24	291.896	293.861	1.965	Mmm, not quite.		
102	24	295.62	298.712	3.092		it probably goes this way. There!	
102	24	298.002	300.301	2.299	Oh, nice job turning it to make it fit.		
102	24	300.93	302.533	1.603		Can I have this one?	
102	24	302.395	302.872	0.477	Yep!		
102	24	305.775	307.844	2.069	Mmm, not quite.		
102	24	308.605	311.162	2.557		This is a very tricky puzzle.	
102	24	310.955	313.598	2.643	It is. But I'm having fun, how 'bout you?		
102	24	314.141	315.25	1.109		Yeah.	
102	24	316.034	320.695	4.661		But this one, is this one a little too tricky for us?	
102	24	320.706	329.341	8.635	Well I don't know if we're, we don't have colors like that yet. Why don't we put that down and do you think we could find the the other oran-, you got it!		
102	24	329.263	331.016	1.753		*laughing*	
102	24	329.693	330.797	1.104	Nice job!		
102	24	331.372	333.486	2.114	Do you think we could find the other orange piece for the octopus?		
102	24	334.097	334.936	0.839		Ok.	
102	24	335.398	336.553	1.155	Oh, try turning it.		
102	24	340.361	340.918	0.557	There you go.		
102	24	340.797	343.918	3.121		And there's a purple octopus.	
102	24	343.693	344.894	1.201	A purple octopus?		
102	24	345.209	348.031	2.822	Actually, do you remember which kind of plant Nemo lives in?		
102	24	348.186	350.376	2.19	Or, what kind of, where Nemo lives?		
102	24	350.91	352.376	1.466		Umm, in this?	
102	24	352.169	353.64	1.471	Yeah, in the anemone.		
102	24	357.482	358.177	0.695	Hmm.		
102	24	364.333	365.057	0.724	Good job.		
102	24	366.221	367.152	0.931	Oh! You know what?		
102	24	367.194	367.884	0.69		What?	
102	24	368.386	369.363	0.977	What kind of piece is that?		
102	24	369.928	370.928	1.0		Corner.	
102	24	371.235	372.523	1.288	Only one corner left.		
102	24	373.709	375.652	1.943	Here, let's move these pieces over.		
102	24	375.959	377.706	1.747	So you can reach the whole puzzle, ok?		
102	24	377.806	378.57	0.764		Ok.	
102	24	381.409	382.001	0.592	Hmm.		
102	24	382.156	383.621	1.465	What kind of colors are on that piece?		
102	24	385.389	390.578	5.189		I think this one goes somewhere else.	
102	24	390.7	393.462	2.762	I think it goes, might go up here with the other pink pieces.		
102	24	394.535	395.785	1.25	You want to try it up here?		
102	24	396.559	398.09	1.531		Let's try.	
102	24	400.383	405.56	5.177		And see. Whoa! This one is a river one.	
102	24	406.475	406.877	0.402	Oh!		
102	24	407.679	408.551	0.872	Good job.		
102	24	408.825	411.282	2.457		This one is really big.	
102	24	411.428	413.775	2.347	I found one more edge piece.		
102	24	414.688	415.779	1.091	Where are there still edges?		
102	24	418.041	419.717	1.676		You mean it goes here?	
102	24	419.748	420.437	0.689	You think so?		
102	24	420.393	423.253	2.86		Yeah, 'cause that was a crab.	
102	24	421.082	422.088	1.006	Good job.		
102	24	427.38	429.142	1.762	Oh! What if you try up a little bit?		
102	24	433.067	433.719	0.652		There!	
102	24	433.64	435.542	1.902	Alright, and one more edge piece.		
102	24	441.386	444.667	3.281	Umm, not there. Let's try the other edge spot.		
102	24	448.913	449.626	0.713	Good job.		
102	24	450.455	452.333	1.878	Oh! That one's a little bit stuck.		
102	24	455.383	461.804	6.421		Is this, is it the Nemo puzzle?	
102	24	462.134	463.634	1.5	Well, it's an under the sea puzzle.		
102	24	465.634	470.573	4.939		Well, w-, I don't know if it's the Nemo puzzle.	
102	24	466.77	467.49	0.72	One more.		
102	24	470.602	474.127	3.525	Oh, take a look at the pictures and see if you can twist it so it fits.		
102	24	477.896	478.389	0.493			24 piece done.
102	48	544.578	545.267	0.689			48 piece start.
102	48	545.568	546.117	0.549			experimenter leaves.
102	48	545.788	547.886	2.098	Alright, how do you want to take the pieces out of this one?		
102	48	549.089	552.492	3.403		Umm, do one by one again.	
102	48	552.238	554.801	2.563	Ok, you start over there, I'll start over here.		
102	48	555.388	557.95	2.562		I found a small piece.	
102	48	557.826	559.742	1.916	Yeah, these pieces are smaller.		
102	48	559.878	561.857	1.979		Yeah, why?	
102	48	562.461	563.593	1.132	Why do you think?		
102	48	568.207	571.089	2.882		Maybe they really really tiny.	
102	48	572.194	575.006	2.812	I think they're smaller 'cause there's more pieces.		
102	48	579.194	583.826	4.632	So because the puzzle's the same size but there's more pieces they had to cut each piece smaller.		
102	48	584.916	585.784	0.868	Make sense?		
102	48	586.132	586.902	0.77		Yeah.	
102	48	587.069	589.438	2.369	Alright. Oh, this one's gonna be tricky.		
102	48	588.153	588.833	0.68		Wow.	
102	48	590.875	591.611	0.736		Whoa.	
102	48	592.326	593.048	0.722		Is this	
102	48	592.326	594.013	1.687	I like that frog up in the corner.		
102	48	595.913	597.441	1.528	And the big cat down here.		
102	48	597.728	599.166	1.438	Do you think that cat looks like ###?		
102	48	599.59	600.666	1.076		Yeah.	
102	48	605.145	608.194	3.049		We have a lot of pieces.	
102	48	608.11	609.985	1.875	We do. How many do you think there are?		
102	48	613.846	615.443	1.597		Wow.	
102	48	615.03	616.273	1.243	Alright, let's mix 'em up.		
102	48	620.638	621.979	1.341	Are you mixing in circles?		
102	48	621.946	622.999	1.053		Yeah.	
102	48	622.853	624.178	1.325	Can you mix in a triangle?		
102	48	626.738	627.572	0.834	*laughing*		
102	48	627.887	630.703	2.816	Alright, let's mix these top pieces up too.		
102	48	632.843	634.808	1.965	Alright, let's push 'em over on the edges.		
102	48	637.838	639.434	1.596	So we can have room for our frame.		
102	48	641.71	643.93	2.22	Alright, where do you want to start with this puzzle?		
102	48	644.736	647.28	2.544		Umm, at a corner.	
102	48	647.354	648.161	0.807	Ok.		
102	48	648.331	649.024	0.693		Frog.	
102	48	648.61	650.149	1.539	Did you find the frog corner?		
102	48	650.142	651.09	0.948		Yeah.	
102	48	651.074	651.807	0.733	Cool.		
102	48	651.787	654.086	2.299		*laughing*	
102	48	653.666	655.205	1.539	Oh, you know what?		
102	48	657.785	660.869	3.084	I think it's easy to find big leopard pieces.		
102	48	661.025	664.506	3.481	Should we put all the leopard pieces over here and try and put the leopard together?		
102	48	668.215	670.722	2.507		I found another ### piece.	
102	48	669.809	670.543	0.734	Did you?		
102	48	670.816	671.77	0.954	Does it fit?		
102	48	672.439	675.134	2.695	Oh, let's take a look. I don't think that one matches.		
102	48	678.258	679.453	1.195	But you know what?		
102	48	680.263	682.79	2.527	These two kind of look the same, do you think they go together?		
102	48	684.02	685.118	1.098		Maybe.	
102	48	685.809	686.927	1.118	Oh, I think they do.		
102	48	687.605	690.618	3.013	And it looks like they're an edge piece. Can we put them on an edge?		
102	48	687.74	689.643	1.903		Yeah!	
102	48	691.698	694.059	2.361		Maybe on this edge.	
102	48	694.051	696.765	2.714	Well, let's take a look at the picture. Which way do you think is up?		
102	48	697.853	699.677	1.824	Here, put the pieces down in the middle.		
102	48	702.035	703.285	1.25	Which way do you think is up?		
102	48	703.303	705.035	1.732	Do you think the picture goes this way.		
102	48	705.739	706.666	0.927	Or this way.		
102	48	707.363	708.321	0.958	Or this way.		
102	48	708.93	709.698	0.768	Or this way.		
102	48	710.426	711.725	1.299		Umm, this way.	
102	48	711.639	714.175	2.536	Ok, so what edge does it have to go on.		
102	48	714.696	715.44	0.744		Here.	
102	48	715.467	716.376	0.909	Good job.		
102	48	717.741	718.515	0.774		We did it.	
102	48	719.149	720.1	0.951	Good job.		
102	48	722.23	724.425	2.195		I knew it goes there.	
102	48	723.659	725.848	2.189	Oh! I found another corner piece.		
102	48	726.189	727.25	1.061	Where should we put that?		
102	48	727.447	728.667	1.22		Maybe here?	
102	48	729.407	730.084	0.677	Maybe.		
102	48	730.601	732.449	1.848	Is that way with the picture up?		
102	48	733.29	734.729	1.439	Or is that way with the picture up?		
102	48	736.633	738.883	2.25	You think there? Ok, let's leave it there for now.		
102	48	741.414	743.67	2.256		And I found the ant.	
102	48	744.118	745.136	1.018	You found the ant?		
102	48	745.715	747.8	2.085	Hmm, do you see the rest of the ant?		
102	48	747.808	749.644	1.836	Did you fall off your chair again?		
102	48	749.692	751.674	1.982		*laughing*. Yeah.	
102	48	753.09	758.425	5.335		Whoa! I found another ant!	
102	48	757.981	760.829	2.848	And I think here's some other ant. Oh, do those go together?		
102	48	761.054	762.158	1.104		No.	
102	48	764.097	765.218	1.121	What about those?		
102	48	765.769	767.032	1.263		Yeah!	
102	48	766.903	768.5	1.597	Do you remember where the ants were?		
102	48	768.881	769.838	0.957		Where?	
102	48	769.959	771.819	1.86	I don't remember, do you remember?		
102	48	771.849	772.648	0.799		No.	
102	48	773.031	774.44	1.409	Why don't we put them over here.		
102	48	774.921	776.866	1.945	And we'll see if we can find a spot for them.		
102	48	777.761	778.164	0.403	Ok?		
102	48	778.806	780.111	1.305	Let's put the ants together.		
102	48	780.205	781.168	0.963	Oh, you know what?		
102	48	782.183	783.366	1.183	There. Ants.		
102	48	784.966	786.575	1.609	Hmm, what next?		
102	48	787.102	789.358	2.256	I'm still working on the leopard.		
102	48	791.96	794.284	2.324		Can I help you work on it?	
102	48	792.359	792.651	0.292	Oh!		
102	48	794.171	795.248	1.077	Yeah.		
102	48	795.66	798.952	3.292	Oh! I think, do you think that ways up?		
102	48	802.285	804.791	2.506		Whoa! We have it.	
102	48	803.405	805.34	1.935	Oh, I found another piece of leopard eye.		
102	48	805.914	807.232	1.318		Yeah.	
102	48	808.135	809.602	1.467		Whoa.	
102	48	811.475	812.098	0.623		There.	
102	48	812.296	813.529	1.233	What comes under the eyes?		
102	48	816.682	817.451	0.769		Hmm.	
102	48	817.13	818.367	1.237	What's under your eyes?		
102	48	819.214	820.33	1.116		Nose.	
102	48	820.256	821.823	1.567	Let's see if we can find leopard nose.		
102	48	822.121	824.548	2.427		*noises*	
102	48	825.959	826.983	1.024		Nose.	
102	48	827.058	827.833	0.775	Nose.		
102	48	828.545	830.503	1.958	Can you find the nose under the eyes?		
102	48	832.106	832.947	0.841	Cool.		
102	48	832.949	836.577	3.628		*laughing* *noises*	
102	48	833.814	834.906	1.092	What about the rest of the nose?		
102	48	842.048	842.602	0.554	Oh.		
102	48	842.987	848.53	5.543		*laughing*	
102	48	844.188	846.242	2.054	Maybe not. What color is the nose?		
102	48	848.907	849.809	0.902		Red.	
102	48	849.953	852.22	2.267	So can you find a piece of leopard with some red on it?		
102	48	852.138	854.486	2.348		*laughing*	
102	48	852.717	853.603	0.886	There you go.		
102	48	855.772	857.217	1.445	That was pretty silly.		
102	48	857.155	859.22	2.065		*laughing*	
102	48	860.304	865.771	5.467		I didn't know that we needed a red leopard nose.	
102	48	865.853	866.841	0.988	Hmm.		
102	48	866.398	868.453	2.055		*laughing*	
102	48	868.409	869.562	1.153	Alright.		
102	48	869.793	871.543	1.75		I found a piece.	
102	48	871.927	872.713	0.786	Hmm.		
102	48	874.945	875.89	0.945		Whoa.	
102	48	876.981	877.871	0.89		*laughing*	
102	48	877.331	879.368	2.037	Oh! Good job turning it to find the spot.		
102	48	879.212	883.639	4.427		I found a top of the leopard.	
102	48	883.153	884.141	0.988	Oh, nice job.		
102	48	884.558	886.814	2.256		Wow!	
102	48	886.152	887.469	1.317	You know what I see over here?		
102	48	887.898	888.471	0.573		What?	
102	48	888.321	891.992	3.671	I see some blue butterfly. Should we work on the blue butterfly next?		
102	48	894.286	897.005	2.719	Oh, hang on a sec. What kind of piece is that?		
102	48	897.971	898.794	0.823		Edge.	
102	48	898.829	899.89	1.061	Is this an edge piece?		
102	48	900.423	901.551	1.128		No.	
102	48	901.557	902.764	1.207	No? So.		
102	48	905.237	907.767	2.53	Oh, what happens if the move that over?		
102	48	908.969	910.451	1.482		It connects.	
102	48	910.396	911.329	0.933	Good job.		
102	48	912.546	915.668	3.122		The giant leopard.	
102	48	912.652	912.963	0.311	Oh!		
102	48	915.755	917.157	1.402	I found a piece of the butterfly.		
102	48	917.825	919.605	1.78		Wow.	
102	48	920.608	922.26	1.652	Can we find more butterfly pieces?		
102	48	923.235	924.87	1.635		I found another one.	
102	48	926.506	927.469	0.963	Good job turning.		
102	48	929.392	930.112	0.72	There's ano-		
102	48	929.566	932.633	3.067		And another one.	
102	48	933.084	934.536	1.452	Oh, is that a corner piece?		
102	48	934.404	935.093	0.689		No.	
102	48	938.36	939.104	0.744	Good job.		
102	48	939.229	942.515	3.286	So now we need a corner piece with some butterfly on it.		
102	48	944.627	946.925	2.298	Oh, that's an edge piece but I bet it goes there too.		
102	48	947.114	947.913	0.799		Yeah.	
102	48	948.552	951.747	3.195		Can I have your corner piece?	
102	48	951.938	952.798	0.86	Do you see it?		
102	48	953.273	954.554	1.281		Right over there.	
102	48	953.946	955.355	1.409	Oh, good spotting.		
102	48	956.177	958.866	2.689		I'll put it in cause I found it.	
102	48	959.188	960.237	1.049	Sounds fair to me.		
102	48	960.611	963.672	3.061	You know what? I think I found a corner of leopard ear.		
102	48	964.035	968.846	4.811		Yeah mmm mmm it is a leopard ear!	
102	48	968.674	969.321	0.647	Woo hoo!		
102	48	970.78	971.786	1.006	Alright.		
102	48	971.542	974.286	2.744		And I found	
102	48	973.594	976.587	2.993	Oh! There's, you're right I think that's a little bit of leopard, too.		
102	48	980.128	982.926	2.798		And some more leopard.	
102	48	985.261	986.359	1.098		Whoa!	
102	48	985.429	986.148	0.719	Wow!		
102	48	986.632	988.937	2.305	What kind of piece do we need here with the leopard.		
102	48	990.731	994.334	3.603	Oh, actually, I think that's a mushroom. What's the piece in your hand?		
102	48	995.437	996.431	0.994		Mushroom!	
102	48	999.597	1002.128	2.531		And a little bit of leopard.	
102	48	1002.225	1003.097	0.872	Ok.		
102	48	1004.511	1005.944	1.433	Looks like.		
102	48	1008.572	1009.352	0.78	Hmmm.		
102	48	1014.379	1017.837	3.458		This one is maybe too tricky for us.	
102	48	1018.413	1019.346	0.933	Hang on a sec.		
102	48	1020.01	1020.992	0.982	What do you see there?		
102	48	1021.291	1022.413	1.122		Frog.	
102	48	1025.02	1026.075	1.055	Good job.		
102	48	1026.392	1028.739	2.347		But where's the other leopard ear.	
102	48	1029.574	1031.239	1.665	Hmm, we'll have to keep looking.		
102	48	1033.031	1033.763	0.732	Do you see it?		
102	48	1034.248	1037.248	3.0		No, it's not on my side.	
102	48	1037.495	1039.196	1.701	Oh, I think I found it.		
102	48	1039.86	1042.196	2.336		Whoa.	
102	48	1042.373	1043.586	1.213	Take a look at the picture.		
102	48	1045.506	1046.939	1.433	Spin the piece if you need to.		
102	48	1050.164	1050.88	0.716	There you go.		
102	48	1052.591	1055.731	3.14	Hmm, let's see? That looks like a tricky edge piece.		
102	48	1056.452	1057.499	1.047	You know what I see here?		
102	48	1057.519	1058.112	0.593		What?	
102	48	1058.323	1059.204	0.881	Frog toes.		
102	48	1060.688	1063.106	2.418	Can you find some more frog to go with those toes?		
102	48	1065.963	1067.519	1.556	Oh! There's more frog toes.		
102	48	1074.012	1075.104	1.092	I found a frog body.		
102	48	1076.19	1078.896	2.706		I- is it a green frog?	
102	48	1078.927	1079.432	0.505	Yup.		
102	48	1080.006	1082.934	2.928	Hey look! There's a big frog. What size of frog is that?		
102	48	1083.498	1084.895	1.397		A little one.	
102	48	1084.906	1085.651	0.745	You're right.		
102	48	1087.55	1088.256	0.706	Hmm.		
102	48	1091.431	1093.833	2.402		I found one piece.	
102	48	1094.99	1097.74	2.75	Can you find colors that match that piece?		
102	48	1099.768	1102.038	2.27		Let's see if it goes here.	
102	48	1102.597	1103.332	0.735		*noises*	
102	48	1102.616	1104.043	1.427	Well, what kind of piece is it?		
102	48	1108.175	1109.126	0.951	What kind of piece is it?		
102	48	1110.089	1110.971	0.882		This kind.	
102	48	1111.753	1113.503	1.75	What does it mean if it has one straight side?		
102	48	1114.013	1117.513	3.5		It goes, this is straight.	
102	48	1117.481	1119.017	1.536	Yeah, it's an edge piece.		
102	48	1120.327	1124.308	3.981	You know what? I think that might be right there.		
102	48	1124.318	1126.274	1.956	**GERMAN**		
102	48	1128.171	1129.004	0.833	Hmm. 		
102	48	1134.011	1135.486	1.475	I see a snake.		
102	48	1136.087	1136.906	0.819		Where?	
102	48	1136.915	1138.043	1.128	Do you see the snake?		
102	48	1138.32	1139.06	0.74		No.	
102	48	1139.59	1141.031	1.441	Do you see him just peeking there?		
102	48	1141.675	1142.602	0.927		Yeah.	
102	48	1142.596	1144.895	2.299	Do you think we can find some snake pieces to go with 'em?		
102	48	1150.488	1153.595	3.107	Whoa, you've got, how many pieces do you have in your hands right now?		
102	48	1154.181	1155.965	1.784		A lot.	
102	48	1155.36	1156.541	1.181	*laughing* How many?		
102	48	1159.543	1160.533	0.99		Aah!	
102	48	1161.278	1165.381	4.103	How 'bout you put those pieces down here and then just use one at a time.		
102	48	1167.043	1168.043	1.0		*noises*	
102	48	1172.065	1173.962	1.897		Is that a snake?	
102	48	1173.957	1175.344	1.387	Does that look like it matches?		
102	48	1175.564	1176.452	0.888		No.	
102	48	1176.172	1177.584	1.412	Why don't you move it over and try?		
102	48	1180.483	1181.017	0.534	Hmm.		
102	48	1181.882	1185.745	3.863	I think that's a snake too, but that's an edge piece. Where would it have to go?		
102	48	1190.176	1193.602	3.426		Right here, maybe?	
102	48	1193.965	1194.867	0.902	Can you try there?		
102	48	1195.86	1197.472	1.612		Whoa.	
102	48	1197.729	1201.622	3.893	There we go. We have one whole row done. Actually, we have two whole rows done.		
102	48	1203.303	1206.445	3.142	Actually, we have two whole columns done, but that's just me being picky.		
102	48	1209.607	1210.131	0.524	Mmm.		
102	48	1211.563	1212.69	1.127	Hey, look at these leaves.		
102	48	1213.697	1216.241	2.544	Do you see them bright green with brown lines?		
102	48	1217.226	1217.986	0.76		Yeah.	
102	48	1217.863	1221.29	3.427	Do you see another, any other pieces that have bright green with brown lines on them?		
102	48	1222.004	1225.033	3.029		I found a different green leaf.	
102	48	1225.082	1225.543	0.461	Ok.		
102	48	1226.313	1229.019	2.706		I found a dark green leaf.	
102	48	1229.347	1231.485	2.138	It kinda looks		
102	48	1232.42	1234.852	2.432	Oh, no, I was wrong, it doesn't go there.		
102	48	1238.921	1239.46	0.539	Hmm.		
102	48	1239.862	1241.793	1.931	We might have to come back to that piece, kiddo.		
102	48	1248.065	1252.016	3.951	Here, I'm going to put the ants down here so we can see if we can find some matching spots.		
102	48	1261.362	1264.303	2.941		Where does the ants go?	
102	48	1265.974	1267.033	1.059	Where do you think?		
102	48	1267.528	1270.2	2.672		Maybe, aah, up?	
102	48	1269.71	1271.082	1.372	You're falling off your chair again.		
102	48	1271.45	1272.513	1.063		Why?	
102	48	1272.366	1275.685	3.319	I don't know, that ch-, wait, stop, can you stand up?		
102	48	1273.537	1274.214	0.677		Aah!	
102	48	1276.053	1277.925	1.872	Put your ants down so I can fix.		
102	48	1279.71	1281.004	1.294	Scoot all the way up on your chair.		
102	48	1281.637	1283.058	1.421	Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.		
102	48	1284.854	1285.452	0.598	*noises*		
102	48	1286.185	1286.758	0.573	There.		
102	48	1290.308	1292.656	2.348		My ants broke.	
102	48	1292.394	1293.86	1.466	Alright, let's put 'em back together.		
102	48	1297.083	1299.46	2.377		Maybe I made all three of them.	
102	48	1299.742	1300.394	0.652	There.		
102	48	1305.676	1307.298	1.622		Where do they go?	
102	48	1307.624	1309.874	2.25	Well, can you put them down so we can see them?		
102	48	1313.661	1316.166	2.505	I think we should look for other things the same		
102	48	1316.465	1317.484	1.019	on those pictures.		
102	48	1318.313	1323.945	5.632	So I see bright green leaves with brown stripes. Do you see any other bright green leaves with brown stripes.		
102	48	1324.661	1325.828	1.167		Yeah.	
102	48	1328.239	1332.533	4.294		Let's think where they belong.	
102	48	1337.219	1339.729	2.51	What if you just try one piece at a time and see if it fits?		
102	48	1342.308	1343.465	1.157		Wow.	
102	48	1351.877	1355.686	3.809		I built the ant.	
102	48	1355.97	1356.7	0.73	Good job.		
102	48	1359.056	1360.34	1.284	Alright, what next?		
102	48	1364.404	1367.551	3.147	Here, let's put, start moving pieces down here where you can reach.		
102	48	1383.437	1385.168	1.731	Hmm, do you see any snake nose?

107	24	10.0	10.9	0.9			experimenter leaves
107	24	11.4	13.0	1.5	Should we w- take it apart?		
107	24	11.5	12.3	0.8		This.	
107	24	12.9	13.5	0.6		Yep.	
107	24	13.5	14.0	0.6	Ok.		
107	24	14.4	15.4	1.0		'Kay.	
107	24	18.0	19.1	1.1		All of it.	
107	24	19.1	19.5	0.4	Yep.		
107	24	19.9	21.5	1.6	I'm gonna keep the pieces		
107	24	21.8	23.4	1.6	turned upright so we can see.		
107	24	24.3	25.2	0.9	Although, you know		
107	24	24.6	27.8	3.3		That's the same thing that she did.	
107	24	28.0	30.4	2.4		With the first puzzle we looked at.	
107	24	29.4	29.9	0.6	Yeah?		
107	24	30.4	33.8	3.3	Should we mix up the pieces a little bit to make it a little trickier for ourselves?		
107	24	33.2	34.3	1.1		No.	
107	24	34.0	35.3	1.3	Aah! Ok, ok, ok.		
107	24	35.7	36.5	0.8	Alright.		
107	24	37.2	37.7	0.6	Ok.		
107	24	37.2	40.0	2.9		'Cause I don't want it to be trickier.	
107	24	40.2	46.3	6.1	Ok. Do you, do you wanna learn a trick that I usually do to make it easier for myself?		
107	24	45.7	46.2	0.4		Uh-huh.	
107	24	46.8	50.2	3.4	I usually look for the corner piece first.		
107	24	50.9	52.4	1.5	Which one looks like a corner?		
107	24	52.5	54.9	2.4	That has like two straight edges.		
107	24	52.7	54.0	1.3		Aah.	
107	24	55.2	55.6	0.4	*noises*		
107	24	59.7	62.5	2.8		Don't even know where they all go!	
107	24	62.9	65.4	2.5	That's ok. We just, you have to start with one place.		
107	24	65.6	67.9	2.2	Does, does this one have a corner?		
107	24	67.9	68.5	0.6		No.	
107	24	68.7	70.2	1.5	This, does this one have a corner?		
107	24	70.1	70.5	0.5		Yeah.	
107	24	70.6	71.7	1.1	Ok, let's try it.		
107	24	72.7	73.9	1.2	Put it in the corner.		
107	24	76.3	77.7	1.4		Put it where?	
107	24	77.8	78.9	1.0	In the corner.		
107	24	78.9	79.5	0.6		Here?	
107	24	79.9	81.2	1.3	This is a corner here.		
107	24	81.4	82.6	1.2	This is a corner here.		
107	24	82.7	85.0	2.3	This is a corner and this is a corner.		
107	24	85.2	86.4	1.2	But now, have a look.		
107	24	86.4	87.9	1.5		Doesn't work.	
107	24	86.7	87.6	0.9	Do the co-		
107	24	88.5	89.8	1.3	You don't need to get frustrated.		
107	24	89.9	93.8	3.9	First you have to look at the colors to see if it looks anything alike.		
107	24	93.7	94.7	1.1		No.	
107	24	95.1	98.8	3.7	Nope, it doesn't look anything alike. You can leave the corner there though, 'cause the corner fits.		
107	24	99.2	102.3	3.1	Now we need to look for colors that look like this.		
107	24	102.7	108.8	6.2	Do you see anything that has the like green plant looking color?		
107	24	108.9	112.1	3.2	Or those blue and grey colors?		
107	24	110.1	110.7	0.6		*noises*	
107	24	112.1	114.5	2.4		This doesn't look right.	
107	24	114.6	115.7	1.1	Ok, well we can		
107	24	115.7	117.6	1.9		*gasp* Those look the same!	
107	24	117.3	121.2	3.9	Yes! Yes. Those look, those look the same.		
107	24	117.7	121.5	3.8		*laughing*	
107	24	121.4	125.4	4.0	So let's try to keep them close to each other because they look similar.		
107	24	126.5	130.8	4.3	Se we can do that with anything that looks similar. Do you see another one that looks similar to these?		
107	24	130.2	132.3	2.1		*noises*	
107	24	133.2	134.2	1.0		*noises*	
107	24	136.6	137.6	1.0		*noises*	
107	24	137.9	138.5	0.6		Here.	
107	24	138.4	140.8	2.3	*gasp* You're right, those look similar.		
107	24	141.1	142.2	1.1	Those look similar.		
107	24	141.9	145.0	3.1		But where does this, where's this	
107	24	145.2	146.3	1.1	*gasp* Wait a minute.		
107	24	146.5	152.4	5.9	Just look at these two. Do you notice anything similar about them? *gasp* Is that his nose?		
107	24	152.6	154.9	2.3		Yeah *laughing*	
107	24	152.9	154.0	1.1	Is that his nose?		
107	24	154.2	157.5	3.2	Ok, where does his nose go? Does your nose go on your chin?		
107	24	155.5	157.5	2.0		*laughing*	
107	24	157.5	162.9	5.4		No *laughing*	
107	24	158.4	160.2	1.8	No. Where does your nose go?		
107	24	161.6	163.6	2.0	Yeah. So where does his nose go?		
107	24	163.6	166.0	2.3		Aah, I can't fit his nose.	
107	24	165.8	169.3	3.4	Turn, turn, turn it until it looks like he's got the nose on the right		
107	24	168.5	173.8	5.3		*laughing*	
107	24	170.4	171.5	1.1	You got it.		
107	24	171.7	173.2	1.5	That's where his nose goes.		
107	24	174.1	178.6	4.5	Ok, let, well let's just leave that right there. That seems like a good, good middle sort of spot for it.		
107	24	178.9	184.4	5.6	Now, we need to find some more yellow. Do you see any yellow around here?		
107	24	186.1	189.7	3.6		Not the kind of yellow it would look like.	
107	24	189.8	190.4	0.5	Huh?		
107	24	191.0	193.5	2.5	You don't see a yellow that looks like your dress?		
107	24	193.6	194.8	1.2	Or like his head?		
107	24	195.2	196.5	1.3	Look around the table.		
107	24	198.1	201.1	2.9		*noises*	
107	24	201.6	204.0	2.4		Only jellyfish but that's	
107	24	203.6	207.9	4.4	What? What? Jellyfish? What makes you think he's a jellyfish?		
107	24	208.4	209.2	0.8		That.	
107	24	209.2	210.8	1.6	Try it.		
107	24	212.0	213.0	1.0		*noises*	
107	24	212.8	215.3	2.4	Is that his body or is he a mixed up chameleon?		
107	24	214.8	216.0	1.2		*noises*	
107	24	217.8	218.8	1.0		*noises*	
107	24	218.4	221.1	2.7	*gasp* I do declare it fits!		
107	24	223.1	224.2	1.1	Is that ok to you?		
107	24	224.6	226.8	2.2		*noises*	
107	24	225.5	226.6	1.0	What's wrong with it?		
107	24	227.4	229.8	2.4		'Cause it doesn't look like it.	
107	24	230.0	232.9	2.9	It fits though, doesn't it?		
107	24	231.6	233.8	2.2		But it doesn't look like it.	
107	24	234.6	235.5	1.0	Ok. Well.		
107	24	236.2	240.0	3.7	I suggest that we move onto the next piece. Yeah, let's just, let's just keep it like that.		
107	24	236.8	238.8	1.9		Let's keep it like this.	
107	24	240.2	241.7	1.5	Now, building off of that.		
107	24	241.8	247.0	5.1		Where do I *gasp* *laughing* I see an eye right there.	
107	24	242.1	244.8	2.7	Do you wanna, do you wanna work on. What do you think this is?		
107	24	246.8	247.7	0.9	Oh my gosh!		
107	24	249.1	249.5	0.5		What?	
107	24	249.3	250.9	1.6	What do you see over here?		
107	24	252.5	253.7	1.1		*noises*	
107	24	254.5	255.6	1.0		*laughing*	
107	24	256.6	258.8	2.2	Does it look like his eyeball belongs in there?		
107	24	258.7	260.4	1.7		Yeah!	
107	24	260.1	264.0	3.9	Alright. Oh my gosh! And that totally fits! It's a straight line.		
107	24	265.0	266.6	1.5	That totally fits. Ok.		
107	24	266.9	269.0	2.2	So who do you wanna work on next?		
107	24	269.1	271.0	1.8	Do you like these tentacles?		
107	24	270.8	273.6	2.8		Yeah! *laughing*	
107	24	273.1	275.3	2.2	Whose. Yeah, you know.		
107	24	275.8	277.9	2.1	You know. *gasp* And guess what else?		
107	24	277.9	278.6	0.6		What?	
107	24	279.0	279.9	0.9	What is this?		
107	24	280.7	283.0	2.3		###	
107	24	283.2	285.1	1.9	It's a corner piece.		
107	24	285.1	286.4	1.3		Where do I put it?	
107	24	286.4	288.0	1.5	Where's the corner?		
107	24	287.3	289.5	2.2		*noises* *laughing*	
107	24	289.0	290.3	1.4	Yeah.		
107	24	290.4	291.5	1.1		*laughing*	
107	24	290.7	291.6	0.9	There you go.		
107	24	291.8	292.2	0.4	Ok.		
107	24	292.5	294.0	1.6	You got it, you got it.		
107	24	292.5	294.3	1.9		*noises* *laughing*	
107	24	294.7	297.6	2.9	But you might have to turn it around to make it fit.		
107	24	300.3	302.2	2.0	Perfect. Perfect.		
107	24	301.3	301.9	0.6		*noises*	
107	24	302.5	303.0	0.5	Ok.		
107	24	303.6	305.4	1.8	Now		
107	24	306.2	309.0	2.8		Next piece goes right here.	
107	24	308.2	312.1	3.9	Yeah. I can't quite tell what goes there yet, though.		
107	24	313.0	317.3	4.3	Why don't we try to work on another corner piece 'cause I can't quite tell. Unless you can.		
107	24	317.7	318.6	0.9	What goes there.		
107	24	319.6	321.5	1.9	Can you find another corner in here?		
107	24	324.5	328.3	3.8	This is not a corner, no, no.		
107	24	328.8	330.0	1.3	No.		
107	24	331.1	333.2	2.1	Look with me. Look with me. *gasp*		
107	24	332.8	333.2	0.5		*gasp*	
107	24	334.3	336.7	2.4	Does that, does that look like. Ha ha!		
107	24	337.5	337.8	0.4	Ok.		
107	24	338.1	341.0	2.9	But we, ok, you gotta put it in a corner 'cause it's a corner piece.		
107	24	342.8	346.2	3.4	NAME		
107	24	346.4	347.0	0.6		What?	
107	24	347.0	349.2	2.2	Where are the corners of this board?		
107	24	350.3	351.5	1.2	This is a corner.		
107	24	350.4	351.9	1.4		Here.	
107	24	351.8	360.4	8.6	This is, alright, the corner, a corner is where two lines come, like, like in this room where the walls come together.		
107	24	359.1	362.2	3.1		*noises*	
107	24	361.5	366.0	4.5	So this is a corner, this is a corner, this is a corner, and this is a corner.		
107	24	366.6	369.1	2.6	So, we've already got those corners.		
107	24	369.6	371.4	1.8	Let's try a different corner.		
107	24	372.1	373.8	1.7		Why can't we do this?	
107	24	372.8	373.4	0.6	This co-		
107	24	373.7	374.9	1.3	Because it's a corner piece.		
107	24	376.6	378.4	1.7		But why can't we do it right here?	
107	24	378.6	381.5	2.9	Because then nothing will fit onto the side of it.		
107	24	383.7	384.4	0.6		'Cause it	
107	24	383.8	392.1	8.4	And when you, when you're doing a puzzle, it makes it easier if you look for the corner pieces 'cause you know they're gonna fit in a corner.		
107	24	388.8	389.4	0.6		*noises*	
107	24	391.2	392.4	1.2		*noises*	
107	24	392.7	397.4	4.7	So it could either go like that, or it could go like that.		
107	24	398.6	400.4	1.9	Which one do you thinks gonna make more sense.		
107	24	400.7	404.4	3.6	Yup, I think that, too, because of the way his tail is.		
107	24	404.9	406.6	1.7	So where's the rest of his body?		
107	24	407.1	409.5	2.3	Let's find some more grey shark body.		
107	24	407.7	408.3	0.6		*noises*	
107	24	410.2	410.6	0.4		Ha!	
107	24	411.4	411.9	0.5	Yep.		
107	24	411.7	412.2	0.5		*laughing*	
107	24	412.6	414.4	1.9		Can't reach it.	
107	24	414.3	418.4	4.1	Oh. Ok. Let's get all those grey guys.		
107	24	420.1	420.8	0.8		Here it is	
107	24	420.2	422.0	1.8	And see how they fit together.		
107	24	424.5	427.7	3.2		Here's his eye, but where's his eye	
107	24	429.7	432.3	2.6		Which part does this go to?	
107	24	433.8	437.5	3.6	We'll have to experiment a little bit.		
107	24	438.4	440.3	1.8	Trying to fit the pieces together.		
107	24	443.3	444.1	0.8	But, yeah.		
107	24	444.2	450.0	5.9	I mean, one thing to also still take heed of, yeah, the umm, straight sides		
107	24	450.6	452.7	2.1		*noises*	
107	24	450.6	451.7	1.1	The straight edges.		
107	24	455.3	458.0	2.7	So I think you were right that, yeah, there we go.		
107	24	458.5	459.7	1.3	You got it. You got it.		
107	24	459.8	460.5	0.7		*noises*	
107	24	461.0	461.5	0.5	Ok.		
107	24	463.0	465.4	2.4		Think this is, oh, aah.	
107	24	468.6	469.8	1.2		No.	
107	24	469.9	471.4	1.6	No, we're getting close.		
107	24	471.3	474.3	3.1		Let's, *gasp* oh!	
107	24	474.5	477.3	2.8	Mmm, doesn't quite match up.		
107	24	475.4	477.2	1.9		No.	
107	24	477.7	482.7	5.1	Let's try maybe with these two guys together 'cause I see a little bit of yellow.		
107	24	483.5	485.3	1.9	Yeah, that connects them.		
107	24	485.9	489.5	3.6		*noises*	
107	24	486.3	488.4	2.1	And now how does that connect to the rest of it.		
107	24	489.5	491.0	1.6	Wait a minute though.		
107	24	490.9	491.3	0.4		*noises*	
107	24	491.2	493.9	2.7	Do you see that orange octopus up there?		
107	24	494.2	495.6	1.4		No- yeah!	
107	24	496.8	497.3	0.6		No.	
107	24	498.7	499.6	0.9		Yellow.	
107	24	501.7	503.5	1.8	We gotta connect colors, so		
107	24	503.1	504.1	0.9		Part of that!	
107	24	505.0	507.1	2.1		*noises*	
107	24	506.4	508.1	1.8	Ok, yeah, we could do that, we could do that.		
107	24	507.6	511.6	4.0		No, not that. I was talking about that.	
107	24	509.0	510.0	1.0	No? Which one?		
107	24	511.7	516.2	4.5	*gasp* Yes! You are right. You are so right.		
107	24	512.7	517.6	4.9		*laughing*	
107	24	518.2	521.2	3.1	Aah ha! This is gonna help us.		
107	24	523.3	527.8	4.4	Now where do those two, keep them together 'cause that was correct.		
107	24	528.5	530.9	2.4	Where do they go with the rest of it?		
107	24	531.9	534.5	2.6		Aah.	
107	24	533.9	537.9	4.0	Mmm, can't just slap 'em on that guy's head. *laughing*		
107	24	537.8	539.5	1.7		But where do I put it?	
107	24	539.7	541.8	2.1	Well, you gotta s- figure out where it fits.		
107	24	542.1	544.0	1.9	Do you think it fits right there?		
107	24	544.2	546.5	2.3		Aah, no.	
107	24	544.9	546.9	2.0	Mmm, no.		
107	24	547.3	548.9	1.6	Do you think it fits right there?		
107	24	548.5	549.0	0.5		*laughing*	
107	24	549.5	551.7	2.2		No.	
107	24	550.2	550.8	0.6	What?		
107	24	551.1	551.9	0.8	Why not?		
107	24	551.9	553.5	1.6		It's not fitting in.	
107	24	553.8	557.3	3.5	Well, with puzzle pieces you have to put 'em on over the top.		
107	24	557.4	559.1	1.7		Oh.	
107	24	558.6	561.0	2.4	Because of that shape, it won't let you.		
107	24	561.6	562.4	0.8	Does that work?		
107	24	562.8	563.5	0.7		Uh-huh.	
107	24	563.5	563.9	0.4	Ok.		
107	24	564.7	567.8	3.1		Where the next piece of him? *gasp*	
107	24	567.6	568.5	0.9	Yep.		
107	24	568.4	569.6	1.3		*noises*	
107	24	568.9	571.9	3.0	*gasp* Yes, yes, yes. Turn it a little bit the other way.		
107	24	573.5	574.5	1.0		That way.	
107	24	575.9	577.1	1.2		That way.	
107	24	578.1	579.3	1.2	Yes! You did it!		
107	24	580.1	582.2	2.1	Ok, l-, do you wanna keep working on that orangey guy?		
107	24	582.6	583.2	0.7		Mm-hmm.	
107	24	583.4	584.1	0.7	Ok.		
107	24	587.0	588.3	1.3		This looks like it.	
107	24	587.4	589.7	2.3	*noises*		
107	24	590.4	591.1	0.7	Mm-hmm.		
107	24	592.5	594.0	1.5		Next piece.	
107	24	594.5	595.4	0.9	Mm-hmm.		
107	24	595.4	597.5	2.0		Purple octopus.	
107	24	596.7	598.7	1.9	*gasp* You got it!

107	24	608.8	610.6	1.8		Here it *noises*	
107	24	609.6	611.5	1.9	You figured it out. You figured it.		
107	24	612.2	615.5	3.3		But where does the next, where's this next *gasp*	
107	24	614.6	618.4	3.8	Ok, that's a corner. Yes! You knew it before I even said anything.		
107	24	623.0	625.7	2.6	Ok. You are doing super now.		
107	24	626.2	626.8	0.6	Ok.		
107	24	627.4	629.0	1.5	Do you see any other purple chunks?		
107	24	630.1	631.7	1.6	Purple chunk, purple chunk.		
107	24	631.7	632.3	0.6		*gasp*	
107	24	632.6	634.3	1.7	Where be a purple chunk?		
107	24	634.5	635.7	1.1		Aah.	
107	24	635.4	637.4	2.0	Yeah, they both have those purple chunks on 'em.		
107	24	638.4	640.3	1.9	So you gotta match up the colors.		
107	24	640.6	641.5	0.9		*noises*	
107	24	644.1	645.1	1.0	Very good.		
107	24	646.1	650.8	4.7		Aah *noises*	
107	24	649.4	652.4	2.9	Mmm, is that pur-, where's that purple?		
107	24	653.2	654.9	1.7		*noises*	
107	24	656.1	656.6	0.6		Here?	
107	24	657.2	659.5	2.3	Mm-hmm. So how can you connect those two?		
107	24	662.8	663.8	1.0	Super.		
107	24	664.7	665.3	0.7	Ok.		
107	24	666.4	667.3	0.9	What's next?		
107	24	671.1	673.0	1.8		I see some blue.	
107	24	673.2	673.7	0.5	Ok.		
107	24	674.1	677.9	3.8		So I might need that one.	
107	24	677.4	679.5	2.2	Mmm, but does it also have the orange in the blue?		
107	24	679.9	681.6	1.7		Aah, no.	
107	24	681.8	684.0	2.1		Doesn't have orange and blue.	
107	24	683.5	686.9	3.3	So look for one that has orange and blue.		
107	24	690.9	694.2	3.2		This guy has orange and blue.	
107	24	694.4	695.3	1.0	Yeah.		
107	24	696.7	698.2	1.5		*noises*	
107	24	698.0	699.7	1.7	Mmm.		
107	24	700.2	703.0	2.9	Keep, turn it around. Turn it around the next way.		
107	24	704.8	705.8	1.1		Why?	
107	24	705.9	706.7	0.8	Be-, well.		
107	24	707.7	712.6	4.9	I would suggest trying it. Those colors look right, they just haven't connected yet.		
107	24	709.9	710.8	0.9		*noises*	
107	24	712.5	714.3	1.9		*noises*	
107	24	715.5	716.1	0.6	See?		
107	24	718.7	719.2	0.5	Ok.		
107	24	719.2	719.8	0.6		*noises*	
107	24	720.6	723.8	3.2		Next piece I see goes here.	
107	24	724.8	726.4	1.6	Wait, look at this edge.		
107	24	727.0	728.8	1.8	That edge tells you something.		
107	24	728.9	731.0	2.1	It tells you that it goes on a top or a bottom.		
107	24	732.4	736.4	4.0		But where does it, where does it go?	
107	24	732.7	735.1	2.3	Or a side. One of the sides is what it means.		
107	24	736.8	740.7	3.9	Well, try, try, try the edge that you've got nearest you.		
107	24	740.6	743.6	3.0		*noises*	
107	24	743.1	745.1	2.0	Yeah. Try it again. Try it again.		
107	24	745.3	747.9	2.6		Can't do it. Aah.	
107	24	746.8	748.8	2.0	You did it. You did it.		
107	24	751.1	753.4	2.3		What is it now?	
107	24	753.7	755.2	1.5		Aah.	
107	24	754.5	756.1	1.6	Like a swordfish.		
107	24	756.4	759.8	3.3	Ok, let's see now. What part do you wanna do next?		
107	24	760.2	761.6	1.4		Aah.	
107	24	761.6	763.5	1.9	Do you wanna keep o-, going on the swordfish?		
107	24	763.9	764.7	0.8	Or that crab?		
107	24	764.6	766.6	2.0		Keep going on swordfish.	
107	24	766.5	768.5	2.0	Ok, who, where's the color that's like him.		
107	24	768.5	771.4	2.9		Aah, aah.	
107	24	771.3	772.2	0.9	*noises*		
107	24	772.4	775.0	2.6		*noises*	
107	24	775.0	776.3	1.3		Here we go.	
107	24	777.6	780.0	2.5		Why you call them swordfishes?	
107	24	780.2	784.8	4.7	'Cause he has umm, this nose that's like a sword shape.		
107	24	785.3	786.4	1.1	If it doesn't fit		
107	24	787.7	789.7	2.0		It's supposed to be here.	
107	24	788.0	788.7	0.8	Try and		
107	24	789.8	791.1	1.3	Aah.		
107	24	790.8	791.7	0.9		Think so?	
107	24	791.6	795.2	3.6	It's close. Try turning it another way.		
107	24	798.3	799.0	0.7		Aah.	
107	24	802.4	806.9	4.5	Try another way 'cause there's four, four different ways you can turn it.		
107	24	811.8	814.8	3.1	So look at how the shapes line up together.		
107	24	814.3	817.8	3.6		I can't do it *noises*	
107	24	815.5	819.1	3.5	*gasp* Oh. I don't think you've		
107	24	819.4	820.4	1.0		*noises	
107	24	820.4	821.9	1.5	Here we'll try it together.		
107	24	822.5	822.9	0.4	Here.		
107	24	823.3	824.3	1.1	Stay engaged.		
107	24	824.9	826.2	1.4	So that doesn't fit.		
107	24	825.7	826.7	1.0		*noises*	
107	24	827.1	828.6	1.4	That doesn't fit.		
107	24	829.0	829.5	0.5		*noises*	
107	24	830.7	831.7	1.0	Does that look		
107	24	831.6	833.6	2.1		No.	
107	24	832.2	832.8	0.7	What?		
107	24	833.2	834.5	1.3	Why doesn't that look right?		
107	24	834.8	836.6	1.9		And it isn't pushing in.	
107	24	836.9	839.5	2.6	*gasp* I think you're getting tired.		
107	24	840.1	841.5	1.5		No, I'm not!	
107	24	841.4	841.9	0.5	Ok.		
107	24	843.0	843.8	0.8	Alright.		
107	24	844.1	845.9	1.8	How do we, how 'bout we finish that crab?		
107	24	845.6	846.5	0.9		Yeah.	
107	24	848.1	853.8	5.7		And I think this part goes here.	
107	24	854.1	854.8	0.7	Yes.		
107	24	856.7	858.7	2.0	Only two pieces left.		
107	24	859.3	860.6	1.2		And.	
107	24	865.7	866.3	0.6		Aah.	
107	24	866.0	867.4	1.4	Do you see an edge?		
107	24	868.1	869.5	1.4	Like a straight edge?		
107	24	869.9	870.4	0.5		No.	
107	24	870.9	872.1	1.2		This one.	
107	24	872.7	876.7	4.0		I think that, aah, tough.	
107	24	880.5	883.0	2.5		*noises*	
107	24	881.3	883.4	2.1	If it doesn't fit that way, try the next way.		
107	24	893.0	899.7	6.7	I think that's correct, you just have to jiggle it. *gasp* *noises*		
107	24	894.5	895.5	0.9			
107	24	899.9	901.1	1.3	You did it.		
107	24	900.1	900.8	0.7		What?	
107	24	902.7	904.5	1.8		What's this animal?	
107	24	904.8	905.6	0.8	A whale.		24 piece fifteen minutes
107	48	1042.3	1042.7	0.4			48 piece start.
107	48	1042.7	1045.2	2.5		That's of the jungle!	
107	48	1044.9	1046.2	1.3	It sure is.		
107	48	1049.5	1051.4	2.0	NAME		
107	48	1052.0	1054.5	2.5	Ok. Here, let's take this one apart.		
107	48	1055.3	1056.1	0.8			experimenter leaves.
107	48	1056.0	1058.1	2.2	Ooh, that's a bigger one.		
107	48	1059.1	1060.9	1.8	We'll mix 'em up a little bit.		
107	48	1061.3	1063.3	2.0		Why?	
107	48	1062.4	1063.5	1.0	*laughing*		
107	48	1063.8	1064.5	0.7	Because		
107	48	1063.8	1066.0	2.2		Because too hard!	
107	48	1065.7	1067.3	1.6	Ok, ok. Well you help me now.		
107	48	1067.1	1067.7	0.6		*noises*	
107	48	1068.0	1069.1	1.0	Take off those pieces.		
107	48	1078.4	1080.1	1.7	Do you do puzzles at school?		
107	48	1081.0	1082.8	1.8		Aah, yeah. Yeah.	
107	48	1084.0	1093.8	9.8		I do. I, I do puzzles at school. I do lots of puzzles at school.	
107	48	1093.5	1094.6	1.1	Really? Ok.		
107	48	1097.6	1099.2	1.7		But not a lot of them.	
107	48	1098.4	1100.2	1.7	Ok. Let's make sure they're all apart.		
107	48	1101.3	1103.0	1.7		But why can't we start	
107	48	1103.8	1106.3	2.4		Why can't we put 'em all apart?	
107	48	1107.1	1107.9	0.8	Umm.		
107	48	1109.4	1111.1	1.7		'Cause it's too hard.	
107	48	1109.4	1109.9	0.5	Well.		
107	48	1111.3	1117.3	6.0	Well. We'll, do, why don't we start how we started the last time, looking for corners.		
107	48	1117.1	1121.3	4.2		*noises*	
107	48	1118.2	1125.6	7.4	Umm, if you can figure out a better way, an easier way, go ahead. But, that's the way I've learned how to do it.		
107	48	1125.8	1128.4	2.6	Umm, just to look for a corner piece first.		
107	48	1128.0	1129.7	1.7		I don't know.	
107	48	1130.5	1131.6	1.1	Yeah, go ahead and s-		
107	48	1132.0	1133.1	1.1	Yeah, there you go.		
107	48	1133.9	1134.8	0.9	That's good.		
107	48	1135.1	1138.6	3.5		But where does the next, where's the next piece	
107	48	1138.3	1139.4	1.1	I don't know.		
107	48	1139.6	1140.4	0.8		to put.	
107	48	1140.8	1144.8	4.0	Well, it looks like this is part of the butterfly.		
107	48	1146.4	1148.3	1.9		So don't we put it here?	
107	48	1148.3	1153.2	5.0	Mmm, it's only part of the butterfly. I think there's a number of parts to the butterfly.		
107	48	1154.9	1157.6	2.6	*gasp* Wait! That was a magic piece.		
107	48	1157.9	1159.5	1.7	It was a magic corner piece.		
107	48	1160.1	1163.2	3.1	Corner, corner. A cor-, a corner. Yes, that's a corner.		
107	48	1164.2	1167.2	2.9	This might just not be that far to the corner.		
107	48	1167.8	1168.9	1.1	But put this		
107	48	1169.6	1175.3	5.7	What the corner means is where two straight lines come together.		
107	48	1176.1	1178.4	2.3	So that can fit snug in there.		
107	48	1179.0	1184.0	5.0		Ok, but where is the right piece to put there?	
107	48	1184.4	1188.8	4.4	Well, let's identify the different butterfly parts.		
107	48	1189.1	1193.9	4.8	And then you can try to guess which one.		
107	48	1194.9	1201.4	6.5	It's gonna be a butterfly piece that some of the umm black with white dots.		
107	48	1202.4	1205.1	2.7	Don't get overwhelmed. I know you're getting over tired now.		subjects leave
107	48	1549.0	1552.6	3.6		Ok, where does the goes?	subjects return
107	48	1556.4	1558.7	2.3	Ok. Maybe she never did turn off the camera.		
107	48	1560.5	1561.3	0.9	Ok.		
107	48	1561.1	1562.4	1.3		What do you mean?	
107	48	1562.3	1576.4	14.1	Well, 'cause, I guess it let's us, let's the people looking at the video know the whole all that transpired. Ok		
107	48	1576.5	1581.3	4.8	Alright, so we were at the blue butterfly with the black border and the white spots.		
107	48	1581.4	1585.7	4.3	So let's try one of the pieces that look like that to see which one's gonna fit in there.		
107	48	1585.9	1589.3	3.3	Again, remember the edges.		
107	48	1589.4	1595.7	6.3	Which one of these pieces has umm, aah, a straight edge?		
107	48	1593.1	1597.5	4.4		Aah, aah.	
107	48	1595.7	1596.8	1.1	There might be more than one.		
107	48	1598.3	1600.6	2.3		Which part would fit though?	
107	48	1600.2	1602.8	2.6	Try, well, you can try it.		
107	48	1605.6	1607.0	1.4	Mmm, not quite.		
107	48	1607.3	1608.8	1.5	So let's try another one.		
107	48	1609.9	1611.5	1.6	Another one with a straight edge.		
107	48	1611.4	1612.5	1.0		Mmm.	
107	48	1613.3	1615.1	1.8		Don't know where ###.	
107	48	1614.1	1615.6	1.5	Does this one have a straight edge?		
107	48	1617.3	1618.9	1.6		Yeah. No.	
107	48	1618.6	1619.1	0.5	No.		
107	48	1619.2	1620.6	1.4	Does this one have a straight edge.		
107	48	1621.0	1621.9	0.9		Nope.	
107	48	1621.8	1622.2	0.4	What?		
107	48	1622.1	1622.7	0.6		Yep.	
107	48	1622.9	1623.6	0.7		Yep.	
107	48	1623.8	1624.9	1.0	Where's the straight edge.		
107	48	1625.1	1625.6	0.5		Here.	
107	48	1625.6	1627.3	1.7	Yep. Ok, let's try that one then.		
107	48	1631.5	1633.0	1.6		Yeah!	
107	48	1635.5	1636.6	1.1	Yep. You got it.		
107	48	1636.7	1641.8	5.1	You totally got it. Ok. But now we still have this other straight edge which could come to our advantage.		
107	48	1642.2	1643.3	1.1	Why not, why not		
107	48	1642.2	1645.1	2.9		Yeah, but the mushroom is no.	
107	48	1644.8	1648.5	3.6	Well, yeah, but we also have more butterfly business up here.		
107	48	1649.5	1654.8	5.3	I was gonna suggest, that totally works though. Totally works. Ok.		
107	48	1655.2	1656.1	0.9	And then		
107	48	1655.6	1656.5	0.8		Where does	
107	48	1656.8	1658.8	2.0	Do you wanna use our, our straight edge?		
107	48	1660.4	1662.3	1.8	Those are both straight edges actually.		
107	48	1662.8	1664.0	1.2	This and that.		
107	48	1664.6	1668.3	3.6	So I would try 'em on, where, this is straight edge here.		
107	48	1672.9	1676.6	3.7		No, that doesn't work. The other way around.	
107	48	1677.9	1680.0	2.1		No, it doesn't work, ma.	
107	48	1680.9	1682.9	2.0	It might just be further up, the straight edge.		
107	48	1684.6	1685.9	1.4		Aah.	
107	48	1687.7	1690.0	2.3		I think	
107	48	1691.9	1694.0	2.2		Right here!	
107	48	1693.6	1697.6	4.1	You got it, you totally got it. Now try, yup.		
107	48	1700.5	1701.7	1.2		Got it.	
107	48	1700.7	1702.6	1.9	You got it? You got it.		
107	48	1702.5	1708.1	5.6		And the last piece is right there!	
107	48	1708.1	1709.1	1.0	Yep.		
107	48	1710.2	1711.3	1.1		Found it.	
107	48	1711.7	1714.3	2.6	Ok. What do you wanna work on next?		
107	48	1714.4	1716.5	2.1	*gasp* Ooh.		
107	48	1714.7	1715.6	0.9		This.	
107	48	1717.3	1718.5	1.2		This is. No!	
107	48	1719.3	1721.5	2.1		That's not part.	
107	48	1722.3	1726.3	4.0		Can you help me with this part? 'Cause this one's pretty tricky.	
107	48	1725.2	1728.2	3.0	Ok, well, what do you see above that butterfly?		
107	48	1729.0	1729.7	0.8	What is that?		
107	48	1729.4	1731.2	1.7		Jaguar nose.	
107	48	1730.8	1738.6	7.8	Jaguar nose. Where, where are the jaguar's eyes in relation to his nose? Are they below it, next to it, or above it?		
107	48	1739.0	1740.1	1.1	**Come here**		
107	48	1739.8	1743.3	3.5		Aah, his nose you mean? Or his eyes?	
107	48	1740.6	1741.3	0.8	**come here**		
107	48	1742.6	1745.5	2.8	Well, well yeah, where do his eyes go in relation to his nose?		
107	48	1745.5	1747.4	1.9	Do they go next to it or above it or what?		
107	48	1747.2	1748.4	1.2		Above it.	
107	48	1748.1	1749.7	1.6	Ok, so why don't you try that.		
107	48	1750.6	1751.8	1.2	**Come here**		
107	48	1754.4	1755.4	1.0	Cool.		
107	48	1758.9	1761.2	2.3		Next part I think.	
107	48	1760.9	1763.0	2.1	You got the right idea that's for sure.		
107	48	1766.3	1768.0	1.7	Mm-hmm. Perfect.		
107	48	1769.8	1771.1	1.3		And.	
107	48	1771.1	1773.0	2.0	Do you see another bit? Yep, you do.		
107	48	1781.8	1783.9	2.1	**Come here, come here, come here, come here**		
107	48	1784.7	1789.1	4.4		I can't get it right there aah.	
107	48	1787.6	1788.6	1.1	Huh.		
107	48	1789.7	1794.1	4.4	It's so close, but, it's not quite. I can't actually see.		
107	48	1794.9	1796.3	1.4		Aah, there.	
107	48	1795.8	1796.9	1.1	Did it work?		
107	48	1797.4	1798.7	1.2	Wait a minute.		
107	48	1799.0	1800.9	1.9		No.	
107	48	1800.1	1803.2	3.1	Something's not quite right. It's almost		
107	48	1803.5	1804.1	0.6		But	
107	48	1803.8	1804.9	1.1	but not quite.		
107	48	1805.0	1807.3	2.3	Yeah, because that hole shouldn't be there.		
107	48	1807.7	1809.9	2.2	'Kay, take 'em out, take 'em out for a second		
107	48	1811.6	1812.7	1.1	And, umm.		
107	48	1815.7	1816.9	1.2	Umm.		
107	48	1817.0	1818.3	1.3		'Cause it should.	
107	48	1818.3	1819.2	1.0	Wait a minute.		
107	48	1819.5	1820.2	0.7	*gasp*		
107	48	1820.9	1824.1	3.1	Wait a second. That doesn't belong like that.		
107	48	1824.5	1828.7	4.2	Oh, we were, we got something a little mixed up earlier on.		
107	48	1827.3	1829.8	2.5		Oh.	
107	48	1830.2	1836.2	6.0	Ok. So, I don't want to lose all those pieces that you already connected.		
107	48	1831.2	1836.7	5.5		Oh.	
107	48	1836.2	1840.7	4.5	There was just something not quite right with that one.		
107	48	1838.2	1841.2	2.9		Oh.	
107	48	1841.0	1843.0	2.0	**Hey you, it's ok.**		
107	48	1841.8	1843.6	1.8		Uh-huh.	
107	48	1843.4	1844.9	1.5	Ok. So.		
107	48	1846.3	1848.5	2.2	What didn't happen right?		
107	48	1849.4	1850.4	1.0		Hmm.	
107	48	1850.2	1853.8	3.6	I mean, that, that, that was right.		
107	48	1854.9	1857.6	2.7		And there's one blue piece here.	
107	48	1860.7	1862.1	1.4		So it should.	
107	48	1861.9	1863.4	1.6	Oh. Does that fit there?		
107	48	1863.7	1864.4	0.8		Think so.	
107	48	1864.9	1865.4	0.6	Or not?		
107	48	1867.3	1869.2	2.0	Mmm.		
107	48	1869.1	1870.4	1.4		Uh-huh.

107	48	1875.1	1876.0	0.9	Ok.		
107	48	1876.7	1879.7	3.0	Ok, everything just needs to shift down a little bit.		
107	48	1880.8	1883.9	3.0	You gotta, there's his eye right there, so you gotta match up his eye.		
107	48	1884.0	1885.4	1.4		Oh, *laughing*	
107	48	1885.6	1892.3	6.7	**Here. I don't know if you really want more of mama's milk or if I can give you binky instead.**		
107	48	1891.4	1896.1	4.7		But where does the n-, where does that, where's that piece?	
107	48	1898.3	1899.3	1.0		Mama?	
107	48	1900.7	1906.1	5.4		Where's the piece that's supposed to go right here?	
107	48	1906.7	1911.8	5.1		'Cause there is supposed to be that butterfly's other eye.	
107	48	1914.8	1918.7	3.9	Ooh, look. I think this just has to move in on top of this.		
107	48	1918.9	1924.5	5.6	It's gonna be a little tricky to put it on top, but here, help me shift it.		
107	48	1924.6	1928.1	3.5		Yes.	
107	48	1925.5	1928.0	2.5	*noises*		
107	48	1928.1	1930.4	2.3	It's tricky 'cause we got multiple pieces.		
107	48	1931.2	1934.7	3.5	We have to just like lightly move it over the top.		
107	48	1934.7	1937.7	2.9	*gasp* Perfect. We finally got 'em in there.		
107	48	1937.9	1940.7	2.7		Mmm.

107	48	1941.9	1943.4	1.5		I don't know.	
107	48	1945.2	1947.8	2.6		'Cause we need to do the other part.	
107	48	1947.5	1949.3	1.8	Ok. We'll find some more spots then.		
107	48	1950.7	1953.3	2.6		I don't know.	
107	48	1952.4	1953.7	1.3	You got one there.		48 piece fifteen minutes

108	48	545.87	550.974	5.104	So let's find the butterfly pieces that are flat for the bottom or flat for the side.		
108	48	551.289	553.268	1.979	That'll help us get the butterfly together.		
108	48	553.278	554.126	0.848	Because it's so small.		
108	48	554.124	557.171	3.047		*singing*

108	48	576.679	582.01	5.331	It fits there, but not there.  The lines and colors don't go, go all the way together.		
108	48	585.793	588.52	2.727	Let's see if it's a type of butterfly that goes along the bottom.		
108	48	593.54	595.514	1.974	It may not be that piece's turn yet.		
108	48	596.943	598.632	1.689	Oh, but it is! You got it.

109	48	862.931	864.181	1.25	See, that's why it doesn't fit.		
109	48	864.011	868.897	4.886		You can't make your own, you can't make your own pieces fit by yourself.	
109	48	864.784	865.784	1.0	But that was a good try.		
109	48	869.193	871.921	2.728	No. That was a good try. So we have to find another piece		
109	48	872.512	874.387	1.875	that maybe connects that piece.		
109	48	875.211	876.665	1.454	Do you remember what connects means?		
109	48	877.813	879.268	1.455	what mean, what it means?

109	48	885.507	886.189	0.682	What does it mean?		
109	48	886.738	896.295	9.557		That means that when you put it together it all makes a big puzzle like this.	
109	48	896.266	898.005	1.739	That's right.		
109	48	898.76	900.226	1.466	That's one and that's one.

109	48	918.028	919.472	1.444	Don't! Don't push 'em off the table.

114	48	247.009	249.149	2.14	Oh, this one needs a flat bottom though, huh?		
114	48	249.81	253.617	3.807	Let's see, here's another piece. We must be missing a couple pieces of leopard still.		
114	48	254.198	255.724	1.526	You see any more?		
114	48	256.067	256.786	0.719		No.	
114	48	256.882	258.461	1.579	Oh, here's like a little teeny bit.

114	48	268.413	269.764	1.351	Where's that one gonna go?		
114	48	270.053	270.684	0.631	Up here?		
114	48	271.575	273.066	1.491	That looks like it.		
114	48	275.965	278.071	2.106	Yeah, that looks like part of the green.		
114	48	279.469	281.644	2.175	Maybe one of his ears? Try his ears.		
114	48	284.251	285.286	1.035		No.	
114	48	284.61	285.119	0.509	No?		
114	48	286.001	287.107	1.106	Try that one again.		
114	48	289.875	290.506	0.631	No?

114	48	293.317	295.948	2.631	*laughing* How 'bout trying it on this side though?		
114	48	297.698	298.715	1.017	That's upside down.		
114	48	299.469	302.592	3.123	There, oh, lookit, 'cause it's gonna be a snake or something.		
114	48	303.306	305.71	2.404		Or alligator, because I think it's	
114	48	304.736	305.683	0.947	Or alligator?		
114	48	306.256	307.555	1.299		saw teeth.	
114	48	307.606	309.711	2.105	Alright, looks like we need one more ear piece though.		
114	48	311.53	313.127	1.597	Is this an ear piece you think?		
114	48	314.135	315.03	0.895		Yeah.	
114	48	317.003	318.757	1.754		Look at that, look at that.	
114	48	317.985	319.108	1.123	Perfect.		
114	48	319.774	321.177	1.403	Now what should we find?		
114	48	322.229	323.913	1.684	This green part?		
114	48	324.966	327.018	2.052	Or you wanna look at the red flowers here?		
114	48	326.974	328.658	1.684		Yeah, the red flower.	
114	48	328.763	329.5	0.737	Ok.

114	48	335.52	336.222	0.702		Yeah.	
114	48	338.273	341.167	2.894	That one can't go on the side though 'cause it needs a flat part.		
114	48	342.018	343.579	1.561	Ooh, I think you got it.		
114	48	347.67	349.319	1.649	Nice! Good job.

114	48	382.186	385.046	2.86	Alright, I guess that's the whole flower there. Now what is this guy?		
114	48	385.786	388.33	2.544		A alligator.	
114	48	387.882	390.303	2.421	The alligator or the snake or something.		
114	48	390.08	391.781	1.701		*noises*	
114	48	392.013	393.68	1.667	Aww, he's a cute frog.		
114	48	393.929	396.543	2.614	He looks like the Rainforest Cafe frog, doesn't he?		
114	48	396.894	398.192	1.298		Yeah. And that one.	
114	48	398.313	399.085	0.772	Yep.		
114	48	400.295	401.857	1.562	Umm, I think		
114	48	401.813	404.357	2.544		I want to start with these.	
114	48	403.501	405.694	2.193	Is this, this, do you think this is this guy?		
114	48	405.157	407.262	2.105		I want to start with this	
114	48	406.858	407.577	0.719	Ok.		
114	48	407.462	408.392	0.93		Yeah!	
114	48	408.295	409.734	1.439	Looks like his eye.		
114	48	410.259	411.031	0.772		Yeah.	
114	48	411.627	412.873	1.246		He's the alligator?	
114	48	413.688	415.548	1.86	Do you see another part of his head?		
114	48	417.285	418.583	1.298	Kinda that greeny		
114	48	419.963	421.594	1.631		Picked it.	
114	48	420.427	422.532	2.105	No, I guess I think that might be right.		
114	48	422.93	424.14	1.21		Yeah!	
114	48	423.482	424.728	1.246	And there's a sloth.		
114	48	425.176	426.669	1.493		What's a sloth?	
114	48	426.383	430.533	4.15	So there's gonna be one more piece of snake that's an edge piece.		
114	48	430.696	432.01	1.314	Is this a piece of snake?		
114	48	435.037	436.753	1.716		No it's a alligator.	
114	48	436.88	438.462	1.582	No, look at it, I think it's a snake.		
114	48	439.029	440.925	1.896	Lookit, 'cause he's winding around.		
114	48	440.604	442.828	2.224		Oh. Yeah, it's a snake.	
114	48	443.119	444.895	1.776	Alright, what you wanna do, the pink flowers?		
114	48	444.961	445.513	0.552		Yeah.	
114	48	445.327	447.088	1.761	The black thing? Is this a toucan?		
114	48	447.297	448.252	0.955	I think it is. Look.		
114	48	448.759	449.64	0.881		Yeah.	
114	48	452.406	453.899	1.493	Mmm, try it up there.		
114	48	455.366	456.948	1.582	Here's another piece of 'em.		
114	48	458.303	459.213	0.91		No.	
114	48	458.833	460.654	1.821	Maybe that one's not going in.		
114	48	462.174	465.413	3.239	Nope, that doesn't have it. Here, this one's got a flat piece on top.		
114	48	462.181	465.734	3.553		*noises*	
114	48	474.999	476.104	1.105		This had one.	
114	48	476.135	477.195	1.06	Mm-hmm.		
114	48	477.337	478.426	1.089		*gasp* Yay!	
114	48	477.777	480.284	2.507	We gotta find some more of him. Oh! Right there.		
114	48	480.477	481.402	0.925	In your hand.		
114	48	485.042	486.325	1.283		No.	
114	48	485.161	486.623	1.462	No. It must have to turn it.		
114	48	487.845	488.965	1.12		This?	
114	48	488.674	489.465	0.791	Mm-hmm.		
114	48	490.828	493.171	2.343	Try it, no, that's not right.		
114	48	494.43	495.58	1.15	Like that?		
114	48	495.869	497.272	1.403	Oh, you know what?		
114	48	495.945	496.855	0.91		*noises*	
114	48	497.505	499.087	1.582	This goes up here in this corner.		
114	48	499.744	500.654	0.91		Aah!	
114	48	500.319	502.423	2.104	*laughing* We had 'em turned sideways.		
114	48	503.384	506.816	3.432	Umm, we need his h-, here's a beak, right?		
114	48	506.482	507.527	1.045		Yeah.	
114	48	507.943	510.749	2.806	We need his head first. Where's the rest of his head?		
114	48	512.717	513.657	0.94	This guy?		
114	48	513.933	514.545	0.612		Yeah.	
114	48	517.03	519.389	2.359		*noises*	
114	48	518.493	519.433	0.94	His beak.		
114	48	520.872	523.096	2.224	Alright, that tricked us, didn't it?		
114	48	523.268	525.253	1.985	We didn't find this corner piece yet. Oh, here it is.		
114	48	526.052	527.32	1.268	This one here.		
114	48	526.096	526.962	0.866		Yeah.	
114	48	528.758	530.534	1.776		And then	
114	48	531.076	532.942	1.866	Now we have the flowers.		
114	48	534.619	535.584	0.965	Where's this one?		
114	48	536.021	537.883	1.862	Do they have a piece of the orange flower in it?		
114	48	538.711	539.642	0.931		Yeah.	
114	48	539.97	541.59	1.62	What's this right here by you?		
114	48	542.315	543.177	0.862	Does that have it?		
114	48	542.735	546.425	3.69		Oh, it's, it's orange.	
114	48	545.707	546.787	1.08	Nice work.		
114	48	547.37	549.548	2.178		Now we need the *gasp*	
114	48	550.086	550.921	0.835	Some more orange?		
114	48	551.109	553.963	2.854		*noises*	
114	48	553.657	555.511	1.854	What is that? That's got somebody's foot on it.		
114	48	556.461	557.843	1.382	Oh here's a piece like a foot.		
114	48	559.06	560.048	0.988	Does it go around there?		
114	48	560.609	561.731	1.122		It's a paw.	
114	48	561.317	563.374	2.057	I think this is part of that orange flower, isn't it?		
114	48	563.5	564.43	0.93		Yeah.	
114	48	566.042	566.774	0.732		I did that	
114	48	566.44	569.51	3.07	So then this must be a frog right here 'cause he's got two legs.		
114	48	569.854	570.835	0.981	Nice. Good job.		
114	48	571.241	573.21	1.969		Yeah, and I need, I need to	
114	48	572.824	573.869	1.045	For his body.		
114	48	574.295	575.13	0.835		Yeah.	
114	48	576.555	577.434	0.879	Mm-hmm.		
114	48	578.3	579.319	1.019	Good eyes.		
114	48	584.139	587.7	3.561	Oh, we're missing another piece of the leopard's ear. I didn't even notice that.		
114	48	589.759	590.689	0.93	Maybe, is this it?		
114	48	590.748	591.239	0.491		Yeah!	
114	48	595.539	595.997	0.458	Ok.		
114	48	597.278	599.303	2.025	*laughing* You clearing your throat.		
114	48	599.41	600.328	0.918		Mm-hmm.	
114	48	599.736	602.455	2.719	Mmm, wait, does the mushroom come over here by the other mushrooms?		
114	48	603.064	603.503	0.439		Yeah.	
114	48	603.869	606.729	2.86		*noises*	
114	48	605.949	606.643	0.694	There we go.		
114	48	606.819	608.749	1.93		There's the top of the mushroom.	
114	48	607.566	608.955	1.389	And that pretty flower.		
114	48	610.252	610.997	0.745	What else?		
114	48	612.058	614.032	1.974	Well this is some of these green leaves here.		
114	48	617.843	619.136	1.293	Ew, some ants.		
114	48	620.715	624.486	3.771	I'm thinking that might be part of the sloth up there. Don't you think so?		
114	48	624.613	625.881	1.268	'Cause look, he has claws.		
114	48	626.546	626.941	0.395		Yeah.	
114	48	630.868	632.365	1.497		What's a sloth?	
114	48	631.311	631.935	0.624	And that's		
114	48	633.026	633.803	0.777	A sloth?		
114	48	634.074	635.934	1.86	Those are, they're, umm		
114	48	636.765	639.351	2.586	They climb trees and they go really slow.		
114	48	640.149	642.245	2.096		Let's do the ants.	
114	48	640.548	641.892	1.344	And they sleep a lot.		
114	48	642.527	642.877	0.35	Ok.		
114	48	645.005	646.693	1.688	I'm pretty sure there's one at the zoo.		
114	48	647.223	648.688	1.465	I'm trying to remember where it's at.		
114	48	650.146	650.936	0.79	Mmm.		
114	48	652.957	653.791	0.834	Good job.		
114	48	657.31	659.202	1.892	I think that's the sloth's other arm, isn't it?		
114	48	659.494	661.36	1.866	Lookit right there. His fingers.		
114	48	661.971	663.397	1.426		Yay.	
114	48	663.619	665.205	1.586	Put the flat part up on the top.		
114	48	670.552	671.335	0.783	Nice.		
114	48	672.804	674.212	1.408	Now it's coming together.		
114	48	676.702	678.492	1.79		Piece of the sloth.	
114	48	678.436	680.882	2.446	Part of the sloth? I don't know, it's got a flat part on it.		
114	48	684.131	684.864	0.733		Yeah.	
114	48	684.249	685.472	1.223	This was a tricky puzzle.		
114	48	685.956	687.389	1.433	Lot's of green on it, huh?		
114	48	687.897	688.591	0.694		Yeah.	
114	48	691.416	692.875	1.459		I think we did	
114	48	692.604	694.069	1.465	Two pieces left.		
114	48	694.846	695.528	0.682		'Kay.	
114	48	696.397	698.658	2.261	I think you, maybe you gotta turn it?

114	24	862.738	864.384	1.646		The jellyfish.	
114	24	865.028	866.892	1.864	You think the arms should go up in the air?		
114	24	867.808	873.114	5.306		No, I think it, the jellyfish is turned backwards.	
114	24	873.071	874.276	1.205	Oh so you can't see his face?

114	24	874.757	876.363	1.606	I don't think jellyfish have		
114	24	877.613	878.347	0.734	a face.		
114	24	880.291	881.516	1.225	They don't have a heart.		
114	24	884.485	886.703	2.218	They don't have any bones I don't think.		
114	24	890.455	892.04	1.585	That's not right.		
114	24	894.491	895.409	0.918		Uh-oh	
114	24	894.719	896.494	1.775	Alright, let's see what's next.		
114	24	898.563	901.359	2.796	This is a fin of a, of a fish.

114	24	904.138	904.519	0.381		No.	
114	24	904.743	907.967	3.224	This is, this looks like a fin of a fish. Is there a blue fish?

114	24	918.263	919.27	1.007	Hmm.

114	24	924.991	925.665	0.674		Aah!	
114	24	925.614	926.348	0.734	He needs a tail.		
114	24	926.824	931.075	4.251		*noises*	
114	24	931.604	932.827	1.223	There's part of his fin.		
114	24	931.776	934.878	3.102		*noises*	
114	24	933.468	934.977	1.509	But that's not the whole thing.		
114	24	937.864	938.921	1.057		It's a shark.	
114	24	939.165	940.133	0.968	How 'bout this one.		
114	24	942.063	943.522	1.459	Is that part of his tail?		
114	24	944.316	945.15	0.834		Yeah.	
114	24	946.386	949.851	3.465		It could go on the ###

114	24	954.759	959.664	4.905	Well this is where, lookit, this is his tail down here so you gotta put the end of the tail somewhere down there		
114	24	959.782	960.929	1.147	So that, yeah, it doesn't fit.		
114	24	961.45	962.947	1.497	How 'bout this? Is that part of 'em?		
114	24	963.673	966.686	3.013	That looks like it's part of a different fish but I think that might be his tail.		
114	24	968.151	968.773	0.622	Try it out.		
114	24	970.984	974.044	3.06	Remember this is his tail down here, lookit, his body his body goes down there.		
114	24	975.918	977.295	1.377		There's the crab.	
114	24	976.708	977.504	0.796	Does it fit?		
114	24	977.865	978.464	0.599	Perfect.		
114	24	978.505	979.607	1.102		It's a crab.	
114	24	979.544	980.598	1.054	Now where is that one gonna go?		
114	24	981.317	982.382	1.065	Nope. Lookit.		
114	24	981.424	982.514	1.09		*noises*	
114	24	982.828	984.415	1.587	This is part of his tail, remember?		
114	24	984.561	984.95	0.389		Mm-hmm.	
114	24	985.942	987.343	1.401	So if this is his tail		
114	24	988.838	990.335	1.497	Is it gonna go down here or up there?		
114	24	992.486	993.266	0.78	Think you're right.		
114	24	993.412	994.548	1.136	What is this one here?

114	24	1004.451	1004.909	0.458		Yeah.	
114	24	1005.545	1008.059	2.514		Because it had tiny pieces.

114	24	1030.687	1031.636	0.949		I don't know.	
114	24	1032.194	1033.652	1.458	Look at all the legs he has.		
114	24	1033.721	1035.044	1.323		Octopus!	
114	24	1034.603	1035.665	1.062	*laughing*		
114	24	1036.066	1037.083	1.017		And a

114	24	1059.727	1062.751	3.024	It's not gonna go on the bottom cause there's no flat, right?		
114	24	1064.051	1064.794	0.743		Yeah.	
114	24	1064.865	1066.027	1.162	So he must be part of the		
114	24	1067.868	1069.959	2.091	Those are barnacle living on the whale maybe.
