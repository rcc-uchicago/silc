67	24	1199.904	1203.242	3.338	I think that's part of the crab, it's, it's pinchers.	
67	24	1205.771	1208.212	2.441	Can you turn it?	
67	24	1206.051	1207.232	1.181		Ugh!
67	24	1209.212	1212.225	3.013	Sounds like you're getting frustrated.	
67	24	1211.263	1214.134	2.871		I am getting frustrated at you.
67	24	1214.529	1215.62	1.091	Okay.		
67	24	1218.048	1220.762	2.714		Where does this piece go?	
67	24	1224.483	1228.678	4.195		Naw-n-no, here.	
67	24	1230.06	1231.333	1.273		See?	
67	24	1232.202	1234.618	2.416		I'm doing the whole puzzle by myself.	
67	24	1238.638	1243.703	5.065		*noises*	
67	24	1247.003	1249.6	2.597		*stop shoving it in my face.*	
67	24	1255.323	1255.985	0.662			End of 24 piece
68	24	2.15	2.57	0.42			Start 24.
68	24	4.64	6.77	2.13	Let's take it all apart.		
68	24	7.71	8.27	0.56			Experimenter exits.
68	24	8.5	10.42	1.92	Then we can put it back together.		
68	24	11.855	12.565	0.71	You'll help me?		
68	24	14.245	15.085	0.84	Ok.		
68	24	17.29	18.7	1.41	Ok! You ready?		
68	24	19.52	21.45	1.93	Ok, let's put some pieces back together.		
68	24	22.43	26.48	4.05	Let's put- maybe we can try to put the orange ones together first?	
68	24	25.98	26.48	0.5		Ok.
68	24	26.96	27.4	0.44	See?	
68	24	28.605	33.065	4.46	Maybe- no let's see if it goes here. Here, try to put it there.	
68	24	34.44	35.69	1.25	Let's see if it fits there.	
68	24	37.96	38.91	0.95	Does it fit?	
68	24	39.75	44.1	4.35	No? Ok, let's try another piece. Umm, where does this one go?	
68	24	44.78	46.2	1.42	Let's see if it goes...	
68	24	48.295	56.235	7.94	Here? No. That won't go there, so we'll try this one. That one fits! See?	
68	24	56.92	58.14	1.22	Where do you think that one goes?	
68	24	59.995	62.195	2.2	'Cause I don't know if this one goes here.	
68	24	63.21	67.19	3.98	We'll see. Let's take this one out. I don't know if it goes there.	
68	24	67.955	69.015	1.06	Let's try...	
68	24	70.555	76.365	5.81	Maybe it- you're getting warm. Then- let me see if it goes, uh, let's see.	
68	24	79.645	81.355	1.71	No, doesn't go that way.	
68	24	84.675	88.145	3.47	It goes that way, you were right! You just had to turn it around, see?	
68	24	89.795	94.615	4.82	Ok, what else? Let's see what else we can put together.
68	24	98.495	108.655	10.16	Hand me- wanna- here- hand me another piece? Hand me that piece. That's ###- yeah, ok. Let's see if this one goes here. Oh, it doesn't.
68	24	109.57	117.79	8.22	This is really... Is it complicated? *laughing* Let's see. Ok.
68	24	120.995	122.595	1.6	I think those go together.
68	24	123.05	127.22	4.17	See that? I think you got something here. Let's see.
68	24	128.71	136.17	7.46	Almost! Let's see- let's turn it this way- let's see if it goes like this. Let's see what you got there.
68	24	137.865	140.075	2.21	I think you have something going here.
68	24	140.695	141.865	1.17	Good job, baby!
68	24	143.465	144.165	0.7	Good job.
68	24	147.24	151.09	3.85	Umm- did you find the other piece? Which piece did you just put there?
68	24	152.31	154.17	1.86	I don't know if it goes there, let's see.
68	24	154.505	158.515	4.01	I think this one goes maybe there. Try it. Pu- put it right there.
68	24	158.715	159.915	1.2	With the other dots.
68	24	163.57	164.55	0.98	Does it go there?
68	24	164.76	171.45	6.69	No, I'm wrong too. So, let's find another piece that possibly look like it can go there.
68	24	171.47	175.17	3.7	Umm, I don't know. What you think?
68	24	175.995	176.835	0.84		Mmm.
68	24	176.75	178.34	1.59	What piece do you think goes there?	
68	24	180.74	183.4	2.66	Wanna try purple on purple? Ok, let's see.	
68	24	188.31	189.0	0.69		Mama.
68	24	188.785	191.665	2.88	Yeah, I- I think you were right. This one did go with that one.	
68	24	190.92	193.89	2.97		Mama, ###.
68	24	193.715	195.825	2.11	*laughing* Ok. Let's do the puzzle.	
68	24	197.715	198.835	1.12	Let's do the puzzle.	
68	24	203.03	206.72	3.69	Umm, wait... now...	
68	24	209.73	215.07	5.34	Oh boy. Ok, let's see. Umm, let me see this one.	
68	24	216.995	218.015	1.02	See where that...	
68	24	224.96	226.04	1.08	Nope.	
68	24	227.525	229.285	1.76	Nope, it does not go there.	
68	24	231.1	234.15	3.05	Wait a minute. It fits there, but I don't think that's the correct piece.	
68	24	236.01	238.0	1.99	Let me see if this one goes.	
68	24	239.58	242.1	2.52	See, I found another one! You have to help me find another one too.	
68	24	243.025	245.315	2.29	You help me find one, ok?	
68	24	247.425	249.895	2.47	You help me find one. Where you think this one goes?	
68	24	251.585	251.895	0.31		Mmm.
68	24	251.895	253.695	1.8	You don't know? Guess.	
68	24	255.36	259.68	4.32	Right there? Ok, we'll leave it there and see if it goes there, ok?	
68	24	260.975	264.395	3.42	Umm... let's see the other piece.	
68	24	265.57	271.26	5.69	Which one do you think? Will you help me find some pieces ###? Now, that doesn't go there.	
68	24	272.68	279.2	6.52	But, maybe you can put these two together, 'cause it looks like they go together. So, maybe, here, try and put it together.	
68	24	282.715	285.515	2.8	No, the yellow one- yellow. Yellow and yellow.	
68	24	286.95	289.12	2.17	It does go there, good job!	
68	24	289.97	291.74	1.77	Did you do that by yourself?	
68	24	292.41	293.04	0.63	You did!	
68	24	294.75	299.31	4.56	Ok, but we got to figure out where they goes here. Doesn't go there.	
68	24	300.095	307.005	6.91	And this one, I believe, maybe goes somewhere down here?	
68	24	308.435	308.885	0.45		*noises*
68	24	308.885	313.395	4.51	No. Ooh! You did that. Cool!	
68	24	314.505	322.545	8.04	Ok, let me- let me try to turn it around and see where that goes. Umm...
68	24	324.94	327.61	2.67	I think some of these pieces go here.
68	24	329.0	338.78	9.78	But, we got to move some of this stuff because it's not gonna fit. Let's see if it fits there... it did. Cool.
68	24	339.945	344.965	5.02	And... let's put them to the side.
68	24	346.99	350.08	3.09	And then, let's do the orange ones first.
68	24	351.56	357.12	5.56	That goes there. But where do you think that one goes? Maybe down at the bottom. Try the bottom.
68	24	360.335	363.805	3.47	Wait, does it go? Wait, let me move this over.
68	24	363.965	369.615	5.65	Let's move that up. It does! Ok, cool, we're getting somewhere here.
68	24	370.475	372.025	1.55	We're getting somewhere?
68	24	374.015	377.005	2.99	*laughing* Wow, you did it!
68	24	377.775	382.535	4.76	You did it! Here's another piece. Maybe- here, put this on top and see if it goes up there.
68	24	382.72	385.79	3.07	In the corner. Right there, put it right there.
68	24	386.42	389.8	3.38	Yes, cool. And then put the other piece there.
68	24	390.995	392.085	1.09	Turn it...
68	24	393.165	401.405	8.24	No, not that way. Like this way. See if it fits. I think you had it right the first time. Try to put it inside.
68	24	403.02	408.26	5.24	Let me help you. I think it goes there.
68	24	409.895	415.205	5.31	*laughing* Good! Ok, let's keep going here. We're getting somewhere.	
68	24	415.625	416.515	0.89	Umm...	
68	24	423.715	425.405	1.69	You have another piece?	
68	24	426.495	428.205	1.71	Mmm, this one?	
68	24	431.775	432.815	1.04	Where do you think that goes?	
68	24	435.71	438.31	2.6	Do you think it goes in here?	
68	24	438.315	440.015	1.7		Mmm, nah.
68	24	438.74	439.23	0.49	No?	
68	24	440.45	441.96	1.51	Or... let's see.	
68	24	443.64	444.77	1.13	Not there.	
68	24	445.2	451.54	6.34	Nope, I don't know where this piece goes. We're just gonna put it to the side, ok?	
68	24	453.125	456.925	3.8	Oh boy, where does that one go? Right there.	
68	24	457.93	459.55	1.62	Yep, it goes there.	
68	24	461.135	461.715	0.58	Umm...	
68	24	464.67	465.22	0.55		Mmm.
68	24	467.32	469.56	2.24		*noises*
68	24	469.065	470.395	1.33	This one goes?	
68	24	470.215	470.695	0.48		Yeah.
68	24	470.77	471.42	0.65	Where'd it go?	
68	24	473.22	474.69	1.47	Somewhere over here?	
68	24	475.17	475.84	0.67	Ok.	
68	24	477.64	482.43	4.79	I don't know, but... it can't go there.	
68	24	482.6	485.21	2.61	It- it's gonna go with one of these pieces.	
68	24	489.37	495.85	6.48	I think... I don't think so. Yeah, it did. You right, it went with that piece.	
68	24	496.415	498.325	1.91	Then we gonna put it all together.	
68	24	501.045	506.925	5.88	This one- this one? Ok, where, here?	
68	24	507.91	508.5	0.59		Mmm.
68	24	509.1	514.22	5.12	Umm... let's see.	
68	24	517.465	519.775	2.31	Ok. That did go together.	
68	24	523.015	523.625	0.61	But...	
68	24	527.515	532.345	4.83	And then we gotta... maybe... no, that's not gonna work in there.	
68	24	534.295	535.005	0.71	Umm...	
68	24	540.685	541.835	1.15	Put that in there.
68	24	544.645	546.065	1.42	Are you helping?
68	24	547.65	548.75	1.1	Can you help me?
68	24	551.085	551.835	0.75	This one?
68	24	555.535	557.025	1.49	Where do you want me to put this one?
68	24	558.805	561.355	2.55	With this? Maybe this piece goes together?
68	24	562.335	562.975	0.64	Yeah.
68	24	563.52	565.39	1.87	Just gonna put it in one of these corners.
68	24	567.93	573.69	5.76	And let's see what we come up with. Huh-uh, that doesn't go there.
68	24	575.425	576.705	1.28	That goes there.
68	24	578.33	580.84	2.51	And maybe... no.
68	24	582.47	586.12	3.65	That doesn't fit. Maybe this way?
68	24	587.54	590.3	2.76	Ooh! It's coming together!
68	24	590.735	592.025	1.29	You like that?
68	24	592.895	594.685	1.79	It's coming all together.
68	24	600.745	602.455	1.71	Where do you think this piece goes?
68	24	603.215	604.225	1.01		I don't know.
68	24	606.475	608.295	1.82	Maybe here?	
68	24	610.31	611.49	1.18		Thank you!
68	24	611.265	614.555	3.29	Yeah, that does go there, but this needs to come out.	
68	24	615.025	617.335	2.31	And then, I think, that goes there.	
68	24	619.275	620.055	0.78	And then...	
68	24	623.3	628.9	5.6	And one of these pieces, this one maybe, goes here.	
68	24	628.945	631.455	2.51	And then, this one goes there.	
68	24	632.645	635.655	3.01	And this one goes there. How you like that now?	
68	24	635.665	636.825	1.16		Mmm.
68	24	636.52	637.4	0.88	It's looking good?	
68	24	638.365	639.445	1.08	I think so.	
68	24	640.64	645.79	5.15	And maybe... no, that doesn't go there. It goes like that.	
68	24	647.37	651.5	4.13	And then, what are you gonna do with that one? Here, why don't you try this piece?	
68	24	652.325	656.645	4.32	Here, you take it, and then put it where you think it goes. Where does it go?	
68	24	659.0	662.74	3.74	Cool! You right, smart girl.	
68	24	663.76	666.15	2.39	Smart girl! *laughing*		
68	24	666.17	669.8	3.63	And you got two pieces left. So, where you think that goes?		
68	24	674.37	682.03	7.66	Almost, I think so. What you got there? Let me see. Cool! Wow, you did it!		
68	24	682.34	687.01	4.67	Do this one. Do the last one. You do the honors of the last one.		
68	24	687.845	688.395	0.55			End 24.
68	48	840.137	841.137	1.0			Start 48.
68	48	849.097	850.633	1.536	Ok, it's stuck.		
68	48	872.901	878.008	5.107	Ok, it's all apart. Let's turn them- let's flip them over. Flip them over.		
68	48	879.055	880.734	1.679	Gotta flip all the pieces over.		
68	48	882.373	894.385	12.012	Flip, flip, flip. Ok, now, we're gonna start with the spots because we're gonna always keep the same color with the same color. Let's get all the spots together, ok?		
68	48	892.986	893.438	0.452		Hmm.	
68	48	894.849	895.766	0.917	Let's do the spots.		
68	48	896.215	900.501	4.286	Is this a spot? This a spot? Any more spots?		
68	48	901.602	902.316	0.714	Here's your spot.		
68	48	902.363	903.315	0.952		Hmm.	
68	48	903.369	904.547	1.178	Turn that one over.		
68	48	904.416	905.154	0.738		Mommy.
68	48	905.541	909.862	4.321	Wow, you did it already so fast! Keep going, put the spots together.	
68	48	910.373	915.647	5.274	You're doing pretty good. No, these spots- we're gonna do these first because those are all the same.	
68	48	918.242	918.897	0.655	*laughing*	
68	48	920.361	921.92	1.559	You did the first piece.	
68	48	923.087	928.397	5.31	That's cool. Ok, if it doesn't go fit, then it doesn't go there.	
68	48	928.541	941.434	12.893	So, we have to put it where it fits. So, let's try another piece, maybe a- another one fits there. No? Nope, not quite. Here, why don't you try another piece and see if it fits?	
68	48	944.099	951.421	7.322	Wow, you're pretty good at this puzzle stuff, huh? Ok, let's do the next piece. Where does the next piece go?	
68	48	953.704	954.871	1.167	Doesn't go there.	
68	48	961.877	962.627	0.75	*laughing*	
68	48	964.805	967.127	2.322	Mmm, that don't go there either.	
68	48	970.35	976.803	6.453	Let me see. It looks like it goes there, but it doesn't go there. Nope, doesn't go there.	
68	48	976.953	984.822	7.869	Maybe if we flip it around. You were right, it did go there, but you didn't put it right... *laughing* you did it good.	
68	48	986.918	993.799	6.881	And then, let's see. Does that go there? Nope, it's stuck. Get it off there, ok.

68	48	1079.062	1085.419	6.357	It does go there, it was just a little stuck. It tried to trick me. 'Cause it didn't fit at first.
68	48	1098.019	1098.65	0.631		Mmm.

68	48	1452.677	1453.26	0.583	Nope.

68	48	1566.543	1568.424	1.881	We're gonna figure out where this one goes.	
68	48	1583.381	1584.488	1.107		Hmm.

68	48	1687.791	1689.077	1.286	You're doing good.	
68	48	1690.71	1694.627	3.917	Ok, now, maybe you can fit some pieces together over there.
