6	12			You should… yeah. Put part of the pig up here. 
6	12		Part of the pig up here? 	
6	12			Yeah. 
6	12		Ok. And how about this piece? Where does it go? 	
6	12			Umm. Right here. 
6	12		Right here? 	
6	12		How did you know those pieces would match? 	
6	12			Because that's part of the sheep and that's part of the sheep. 
6	12		And how about this piece? 	
6	12			Yeah. 
6	12		Right there. There we go. Good job. We did the whole thing. 	
6	12	31800.0		
7	12	27600.0	So this one we're going to do a little differently, ok? 	
7	12		Ok. So, this is our first piece. Can you tell me what I should do with it? 	
7	12			Mmm. There.
7	12		Right here, like that? 	
7	12		How'd you know it'd fit there? 	
7	12		You don't know? 	
7	12		Ok. What should I do with this piece? 	
7	12		Put it here like this? 	
7	12		How'd you know those two pieces would match?	
7	12	31200.0		Because this has has half of it. 
7	12		Ok. It's got part of the barn. 	
7	12		Ok. And what about this piece? Can you tell me what to do with this one? 	
7	12		Right here, like this? 	
7	12		No? How should we fix it? 	
7	12		What'd you have to do to make it fit?	
7	12			### right here
7	12		Ok. And what about this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with this one ?	
7	12			Mmm
7	12		Put it here like this? 	
7	12		How'd you know that would go there? 	
7	12			Because it was the rest. I don't know.
7	12		You don't know? Ok. 	
7	12		What should I do with this piece? 	
7	12			Ummm.
7	12		Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12		How can you tell that doesn't work? 	
7	12			Because there's ### any###
7	12		Ok. So what should we do with it? What do you think? 	
7	12	34680.0	Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12			Mmhmm
7	12		Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
7	12		Right here, like that? 	
7	12		So those two pieces look good then? 	
7	12		Ok. And what should I do with this piece? 	
7	12			Put it…
7	12		Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12			huh uh
7	12		No? Can you tell me where, what we should do to fix it? 	
7	12			Mmhmm
7	12		What do you think? 	
7	12		Here like this?	
7	12		What should we do? 	
7	12		Like that? Do those match? 	
7	12			Huh uh. 
7	12		How can you tell those don't match? 	
7	12			Because that is a cat and this is a cow. 
7	12		Ah, ok. 	
7	12	38400.0	Ok. 	
7	12		What about if we do this? 	
7	12		So how'd you know that had to go there then? 	
7	12			Because this had a corner and that had to go up there. 
7	12		Ok. How can you tell it has a corner?	
7	12			Cause… I don't know. 
7	12		Ok. So where should we put this piece? Can you tell me where we put this one?  	
7	12			Mmhmm
7	12		Right here, like that? 	
7	12		How'd you know it couldn't go there? 	
7	12			Because it didn't have a.. That. 
7	12		Ok. 	
7	12		Where else can we try that piece? 	
7	12	42000.0		I don't know. 
7	12		You don't know? 	
7	12		Should we save it for later? 	
7	12			Mmhmm
7	12		Ok. Where should we put this piece? 	
7	12		Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
7	12		Right here, like this? Will that work?	
7	12		How'd you know to try it there? 	
7	12			Because there was part of the sand. And the pig
7	12		And the pig too?	
7	12		What should we do with this piece? 	
7	12		How did you know it would fit there? 	
7	12			Because it's part of this. 
7	12		Part of that chicken? 	
7	12			Mmhmm
7	12		Ok. What about this piece? Where should we put this one? 	
7	12		Like this? 	
7	12		What'd you do to fix it? 	
7	12			Turn it around 
7	12		Turn it around? Ok. 	
7	12		And how about this piece? Where should we put this one?  	
7	12		Here like that? 	
7	12		How did you know those two pieces would match? 	
7	12			Cause there's part of that. 
7	12	45480.0	Oh, ok. 	
7	12		And how about this last piece? Where should we put this? 	
7	12	45900.0	Good job. All done. 	
8	12	22140.0	Are you ready to do our next puzzle? 	
8	12		Ok, so this is our first piece. Can you tell me what I should do with it? Where do you think it should go?  	
8	12		Here like this?  	
8	12		Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12		What about this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with this one? 	
8	12		Here like this? Does that look good? 	
8	12	25740.0	How should I fix it? 	
8	12		Does that look like it matches? 	
8	12		No? Ok. 	
8	12		Let's see. What if we put it like this? 	
8	12		Does that look good? 	
8	12		Yeah. So should we keep these two pieces here? 	
8	12			Yeah
8	12		Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece? 	
8	12		Right here, like that? Does that look right? 	
8	12		Why doesn't it look right? 	
8	12		Can you use your words and tell me why it doesn't look right? What'd you just do with your fingers? 	
8	12			I don't know how to do this. 
8	12		That's ok. What did you just do with your fingers? When you pointed here and here. 	
8	12			That goes there in
8	12		So this has to go here? 	
8	12			Yeah. 
8	12		Ok. Like that? Does that look right? 	
8	12		What if we do this? 	
8	12	29400.0	That looks like it matches right?	
8	12		Yeah. Ok. 	
8	12		So what if we… Do you think these pieces look right here? 	
8	12			I don't know how to do this yet. 
8	12		That's ok I have the puzzle pieces stacked. So, that one will probably come later.	
8	12		So what if we do this? 	
8	12			It… Yeah. 
8	12		Does that look better? Can you tell me why it looks better? Why do you think? 	
8	12		Why do you think it looks better there instead of there? 	
8	12			I don't know. 
8	12		You don't know? Ok. 	
8	12		What should I do with this piece? 	
8	12		Uh. Like this? 	
8	12			Mmhm
8	12		Does that look right? 	
8	12		Yeah. How'd you know it'd go there instead? 	
8	12		Huh? How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12			I don't know. 
8	12		You don't know? Ok. 	
8	12		Can you find where this piece goes? Where do you think it should go? 	
8	12		Here like this? Does that look like it matches? 	
8	12		No. Ok. Where else do you think we can try that piece? 	
8	12	33300.0	What if we try that piece here? 	
8	12		hmm. Not sure it matches like that. 	
8	12		What about if we try it here? Does that look good? 	
8	12		Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12		Can you tell me what I should do with this one? 	
8	12		How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12			I don't know. 
8	12		What? How'd you get that? You got that on your first try. 	
8	12			I said mmm. 
8	12		mmm. Ok. Is that your thinking noise? 	
8	12		Ok. wha-	
8	12			What's in there? 
8	12		Toys. 	
8	12			Can I see? 
8	12		You can pick one out when we're all done. 	
8	12			Ok. 
8	12			### Ow. 
8	12		How'd you know it wouldn't fit there? '	
8	12			Because it's too big. 
8	12	36600.0	Ah. It's too big. 	
8	12			Know what I have at home? 
8	12		What? 	
8	12			A box and all my toys are in there. 
8	12		Yeah? Does it look like that? 	
8	12		That's pretty cool. 	
8	12			Yeah, but it's not a treasure chest. 
8	12		Ah. It's a toy chest? 	
8	12			Yeah. 
8	12		Yeah. Ok. 	
8	12			No it's not. It's… It's for big people like you.
8	12		Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12		You know what? I think that piece might go here. 	
8	12			Yeah it does. 
8	12		There you go. Good job. 	
8	12		How'd you know it wouldn't go the way you had it before? How'd you know it didn't go like that? 	
8	12			Because it's supposed to go that way. Then it's supposed to connect. 
8	12		Ok. Can you tell me where this piece goes? 	
8	12	40320.0		I don't 
8	12		How do you know it won't go there? How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12		You don't know? Ok. Well where should we put this piece. 	
8	12		Right here like this? Does that look right?	
8	12		Let's see what if we try that one here? 	
8	12		Can you try that piece here? I think it may fit there. 	
8	12		There we go. 	
8	12			It still hurt. 
8	12		Oh, what'd you do to your finger? 	
8	12			Umm I hurt it. 
8	12		How'd you hurt it? 	
8	12			Umm. Because something was stuck in there and had to get it out. 
8	12		Ok. It's a cool band-aid though. 	
8	12			It's a little hole
8	12		You got a cool band-aid to cover it up though. 	
8	12			I can't do it. 
8	12	43740.0	It's ok. Let's try it somewhere else. 	
8	12		hmm. What about if you try that piece here? 	
8	12		Can you just put it a different way there?	
8	12		Oop. I think that piece stays there. 	
8	12		What about if we put this piece this way? 	
8	12		Can you put it here? 	
8	12		I don't think those quite match. Let's try it like that. 	
8	12		That looks good right? 	
8	12			No. 
8	12		No? Well here what about this piece? Where do you think this one goes. 	
8	12			I wanna pick out the turtle 
8	12		I don't know if we have any turtles. 	
8	12	47400.0	I think this one goes here. 	
8	12		What should we do with this one? 	
8	12		How could you tell it would fit there? 	
8	12			I don’t know. 
8	12		How'd you figure that out on your first try? 	
8	12			There's a little more
8	12		Yeah, there are two pieces left. 	
8	12			I ah
8	12			Does it go by a Bah
8	12		A sheep? 	
8	12			Like that
8	12		How'd you know it had to go that way? 	
8	12			Cause. 
8	12		Cause how? 	
8	12			This. 
8	12		Ok. Good job! You finished two whole puzzles. Now we're going to do a couple more with your mom. Ok? 	
8	12	50460.0		
9	12	26220.0	So this one we're gonna do a little differently ok?	
9	12		Ok. So here's our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
9	12			Um, I think it's a corner piece.
9	12		Ok, so where should it go?	
9	12			I think right here.
9	12		Oh ok. And how'd you know it was a corner piece?	
9	12	29880.0	Ok.	
9	12		And what should I do with this piece?	
9	12			Um.
9	12		Can you tell me what I should do with it?	
9	12			I think it's a corner piece too.
9	12		You think that's a corner piece too? So I should put it here?	
9	12			no.
9	12		No? why not? How can you tell that's wrong?	
9	12			Because it's a little bit short up here.
9	12		Oh ok so how should we fix it?	
9	12			I think… hmm, maybe it's not a corner piece.
9	12		No? Can you see where it should go?	
9	12			Maybe right here… no.
9	12		No?	
9	12			I think it should try to go here… no.
9	12		How can you tell it doesn't go there?	
9	12			Because because the leg.
9	12		Ok. It doesn't fit?	
9	12		So can you see where else we should try this?	
9	12		Here like that?	
9	12			No.
9	12			Don't know yet.
9	12		You don't know yet? Ok.	
9	12		Well what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
9	12	33600.0		Maybe right here?
9	12		Yeah, I bet.	
9	12		No? How can you tell that's wrong?	
9	12			Because…
9	12		Oh, cause of that part? Ok.	
9	12			And that part.
9	12		So how should we fix it do you think.	
9	12		That match?	
9	12		No?	
9	12		Let's see… what about if we did this.	
9	12			### oh.
9	12		Now can you tell where we should put these?	
9	12			I don't know.
9	12		What do you think.	
9	12		Where else could it go.	
9	12			###.
9	12		Well should we leave these here for now.	
9	12		That look good? hmm?	
9	12		What could we do with these pieces?	
9	12		Leave them there? Ok.	
9	12		And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
9	12			I have the cat at home.
9	12		You do?	
9	12	36960.0		I mean I have two.
9	12		Oh ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
9	12		What do you think. Where do you think it should go.	
9	12			Right there.
9	12		Right there? How could you tell those two pieces would go together?	
9	12		How'd you figure that out?	
9	12			Because if you take them off, because they have the same…
9	12		Have the same what?	
9	12			They have the same thingy here.
9	12		Oh same thing there? Ok.	
9	12		So can you figure out what we should do with these three pieces yet?	
9	12		Where should they go?	
9	12		There still?	
9	12		What about this piece, can you tell me where I should put this one.	
9	12		Well what if we put these like this.	
9	12			Yeah.
9	12		That look good?	
9	12			Yeah.
9	12		Ok so where should we put this piece.	
9	12			Fitting the fit, fit…
9	12		Won't fit there?	
9	12	40500.0	No?	
9	12			Yes.
9	12		But does it match? That look like it matches?	
9	12			No.
9	12		No? so where else could we put it?	
9	12			Here… ###...
9	12		There? Does that look good there?	
9	12		No?	
9	12			Um… I don't know.
9	12		You don't know? Should we save that one for later?	
9	12			Yeah.
9	12		Ok. Tell me what we should do with this piece?	
9	12			I don't know.
9	12		You don't know? Do you have a guess?	
9	12		Let's make a guess where do you think it could go.	
9	12			I want a break.
9	12		You want a break? Well what if we put this one here.	
9	12		Then can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
9	12			No.
9	12		No? What if it goes there?	
9	12	43920.0	Ok we're almost done.	
9	12		Can you tell me where this piece would go?	
9	12			I want a break.
9	12		You want a break? Ok what if we finish this one really fast and then you go play with your dad?	
9	12		Does that sound good?	
9	12		Ok I think that one goes there.	
9	12		And that one goes there.	
9	12		Can you see what we should do with this one?	
9	12		Maybe that one try it?	
9	12		Go there?	
9	12		hmm, what about if it goes here.	
9	12		There we go and the last one you wanna put that one in?	
9	12		Good job how'd you know it had to go like that?	
9	12			There's only one more.
9	12	46560.0	Yeah, ok.	
10	12	28980.0	Ok well this one we're gonna do a game with it ok?	
10	12		So. Here is our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
10	12			Up here.
10	12		Right up here like that?	
10	12		How'd you know it had to go there?	
10	12			Cause the animals are ##
10	12		Ok. And how about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
10	12	32700.0		I think over here.
10	12		Right here like that?	
10	12			No.
10	12		No? So how should we fix it?	
10	12			Up there.
10	12		Up there, like that?	
10	12			Yeah.
10	12		How could you tell it was wrong there?	
10	12			Cause this.
10	12		Oh ok.	
10	12		What should we do with this piece.	
10	12		There like this?	
10	12			No.
10	12		No? how should we fix it?	
10	12		What about this, what should I do with that.	
10	12			Put it here.
10	12		Right there?	
10	12		How'd you know we had to do that?	
10	12			Cause the legs.
10	12		Oh ok. What should we do with this piece.	
10	12		How'd you know those two pieces would go together.	
10	12			Cause the tail.
10	12		Cause the tail? Ok.	
10	12		And what about that piece what should we do with this one.	
10	12			Um I think down here.
10	12		Down here like that?	
10	12			No.
10	12		That work?	
10	12		How should we fix it where do you think it could go.	
10	12	36360.0		Here.
10	12		There?	
10	12		Does that work like that?	
10	12			No.
10	12		No? Why not?	
10	12			Because
10	12		Here like this?	
10	12			they're not supposed to be upside down.
10	12		Oh ok.	
10	12		So what should I do, this isn't right?	
10	12			Yeah cause the
10	12		Cause the what?	
10	12			This.
10	12		What is that?	
10	12			There wasn't a square there.
10	12		Oh ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
10	12			Up here.
10	12		Here? How'd you figure that out?	
10	12			We put it together?
10	12		Yeah? How'd you know it would fit together?	
10	12			Cause the eyes.
10	12		Oh ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
10	12			Up here.
10	12		Here like that?	
10	12			Yeah.
10	12		How'd you know it had to go there?	
10	12			Cause that.
10	12		That? Ok.	
10	12		And what about this piece what should I do with this one.	
10	12			I think over here.
10	12		Over here like that?	
10	12	40020.0	How'd you know it had to go there?	
10	12			Cause…
10	12		hmm?	
10	12			I don't know.
10	12		You don't know? Ok.	
10	12		What should we do with this one.	
10	12			Up here.
10	12		Up here like this?	
10	12			No.
10	12		No? how should we fix it?	
10	12			We don't need it now.
10	12		We don't need it now? Are you sure?	
10	12			Yeah.
10	12		Ok. So we should save it for later?	
10	12			Yeah. Maybe when we put another piece down.
10	12		Ok. What should I do with this piece.	
10	12			Right here like that?
10	12		How'd you know it would match there?	
10	12			Cause… tail.
10	12		Cause the tail of the cow?	
10	12			Yeah.
10	12		What should I do with this piece.	
10	12		Right here like this?	
10	12			Yeah.
10	12		Like that?	
10	12			No.
10	12		No? how do you know it's wrong?	
10	12			Cause you have to do this.
10	12		Do that? What'd you just do?	
10	12		How'd you fix it?	
10	12			There.
10	12	43560.0	How'd you fix it?	
10	12			I turned it.
10	12		You turned it? Ok.

11	12	48840.0	how'd you know that piece would go there?	
11	12			because I did.
11	12		Cause you did? Ok.	
11	12		what about this piece, where does this one go.	
11	12		how'd you know those pieces would match.	
11	12			I did.
11	12		ok. And what about that piece where's that one go.	
11	12		ok. And now can you figure out where that one goes.	
11	12	50640.0	good job.	
12	12	17940.0	Ok so for this puzzle I've stacked all the puzzle pieces ok?	
12	12		ok. So here's our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
12	12			put it right there.
12	12		put it right here like this?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok. How'd you know it'd go there?	
12	12			because there's a horse right next to it.
12	12		ok. And what about this piece what should I do with that one can you use your words and tell me?	
12	12			you should put it right there.
12	12		I should put it right here like this?	
12	12			no.
12	12		No? how could you tell that's wrong?	
12	12			cause oh.
12	12			should turn it around like this.
12	12		should turn it around like that?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok how'd you know we had to fix it?	
12	12	21300.0		because there was a pig right there and there was a pig right there.
12	12		oh ok. And what about this piece can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
12	12			you should put that right there.
12	12		put it right here like that?	
12	12			no.
12	12		no?	
12	12			you have to turn it around.
12	12		turn it around like this?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		gotcha. How'd you know we had to fix it?	
12	12			because there wasn't a connecting here.
12	12		oh ok. And what about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
12	12			you should put it right here.
12	12		right here like this?	
12	12			no, turn it around.
12	12		turn it around?	
12	12			like this.
12	12		ok. How could you tell I put it in wrong.	
12	12			because the tail supposed to be right here on the barn.
12	12		ok and how about this piece what should we do with this one.	
12	12			I, uh, not ready for that piece yet.
12	12		we're not? Are you sure?	
12	12			I'm sure.
12	12		do you have a guess where it could go?	
12	12			I could guess it go right there but that has but that has a pig on it.
12	12		ok. So do you have another guess where it should go?	
12	12	25140.0		yeah.
12	12		yeah, where. Where else do you think it could go.	
12	12			I think it could go right here.
12	12		go right here? Should we try it there then?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok. Why do you think it could go there?	
12	12			because it's a corner.
12	12		because it's a corner, ok.	
12	12		and how about this piece could you tell me what I should do with this one?	
12	12			you should put it right here.
12	12		put it right here like this?	
12	12			no, turn it around. The face go right there.
12	12		oh ok the horse's face?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok and how did you know we needed to put this piece there.	
12	12			because it has the other connecting, two connectings.
12	12		oh ok two connectings?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok and what should we do with this piece.	
12	12			you should put it right there.
12	12		put it here like this?	
12	12			no. where the pig is.
12	12		the pig is?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		that match right there?	
12	12			no.
12	12		no? so how should we fix it do you think.	
12	12			I think we have to wait for where we when we are getting to the cow.
12	12		oh ok do you have a guess where it could go though, should we make a guess where  you think it could go?	
12	12			I don't know.
12	12	28620.0	you don't know? We should save it?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok. How about this piece, where should this one go.	
12	12			we should save that one too.
12	12		save this one too?	
12	12		are you sure, you don't have a guess where this one could go?	
12	12			no.
12	12		no?	
12	12			but I only see part of a pig
12	12			and another part of a oh I think it could go right there.
12	12		think it could go here like this?	
12	12		that look like it matches?	
12	12			no.
12	12		no? ok.	
12	12		so you don't see anything on the puzzle that could match this yet?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok that's why we should save it?	
12	12		ok how about this piece, where should this one go.	
12	12			right there.
12	12		right here like this?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok how'd you know it had to go there?	
12	12			because it has a pig face and that's part of a pig.
12	12		oh ok got it.	
12	12		and how about this piece what should we do with this one.	
12	12			put it right there.
12	12		put it right here like this?	
12	12			uh, turn it around.
12	12		turn it around?	
12	12			like that.
12	12		like that. How'd you know it had to go in that way.	
12	12			because there's a rooster this way and a cow this way.
12	12	32160.0	ok got it. So how about this piece do we have a guess where that one could go now?	
12	12			yeah right here.
12	12		right there?	
12	12			you have to turn it around.
12	12		turn it around?	
12	12			yeah like that.
12	12		ok how'd you know it needed to go that way.	
12	12			because that because that's the connecting.
12	12		the connecting? Ok.	
12	12		and this piece, we still don't know where that one could go?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok.	
12	12		how about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
12	12			put it right there.
12	12		put it right here like this?	
12	12			uh, turn it around.
12	12		turn it around?	
12	12		and put it like this?	
12	12			yeah.
12	12		ok how'd you know those pieces would match?	
12	12			because. Because, because that's right
12	12		because that's what?	
12	12			because that's right
12	12		ok	
12	12			and that's, now I know where
12	12		now you know where this one goes? Where does this one go?	
12	12			go right there.
12	12		go right there? How'd you figure that one out?	
12	12			because that right there that one's right there this face right
12	12		oh ok and how about that piece, our last piece?	
12	12			right there.
12	12		right there? How'd you figure that one out?	
12	12			because I saw the two pegs.
12	12	36360.0	oh ok. Good job.	
13	12	20940.0	Ok so what we're gonna do with this puzzle is we're gonna play a game with it ok?

13	12			Right here.
13	12		Right there? How'd you know it needed to go there?	
13	12			I could ### so good at puzzles.
13	12		Ok. And how about that piece can you tell me what I should do with it can I take a turn and put one in?	
13	12			Put it right here.
13	12		Put it right there? Like that?	
13	12		How'd you know it needed to go that way?	
13	12			That's because I… that's because I said it.
13	12		You ok.	
13	12		And how about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12		Put it there, like this?	
13	12		How'd you know it needed to go that way?	
13	12	27900.0		That's because I… that's because I do puzzles.
13	12		Oh ok. And how about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12			Uh, put it right… here.
13	12		Put it right here? Does that work right there?	
13	12			No.
13	12		No? How can you tell it doesn't work?	
13	12			I think it fits right here.
13	12		So how did you know you needed to put it there instead of right here.	
13	12			That's because it has, that's because there's a cow.
13	12		Because it has a cow? And so why shouldn't the cow go there?	
13	12			That's because it has a point pointing like this.
13	12		Oh it has a point like that? Ok.	
13	12		Can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
13	12			Put it right here.
13	12		Put it right here like this?	
13	12			You fix it… like this.
13	12		Oh, how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
13	12			That's because you put it in upside down?

13	12	31680.0		Like this.
13	12		Ok. So how could you tell I put it in upside down.	
13	12			That's because this doesn't have this.
13	12		Oh ok.	
13	12			And I turn it around like this, it does make it fit there.
13	12		Oh ok good job.	
13	12		Ok and what should we do with that one.	
13	12			Put it right here.

13	12		And what should we do with this piece, can I take a turn can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12			Put it right here.
13	12		Put it right there? Ok how'd you know it'd match those other two pieces?	
13	12			That's because the cow carried the chicken.
13	12			That's funny.
13	12	34860.0	It is funny isn't it.	
13	12		Ok can I take a turn on this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with it?

13	12		Put it right here like this?	
13	12			No like this.
13	12		ok. How'd you fix it?	
13	12			That's because you turn it upside down like… like this.
13	12		Ok and how could you tell that was upside down?	
13	12			Because you know turn it around upside down.
13	12		Ok.	
13	12			And I turn it around upside up.

18	12		over here?	
18	12		should I just put it in like that?	
18	12		maybe it shouldn't go there?	
18	12		or maybe something's wrong with another part of the puzzle?	
18	12	54180.0	which part of the puzzle is probably not where it should be?	
18	12		maybe if you took this one apart.	
18	12		would you be able to fit it in then?	
18	12		so it's like that.	
18	12		well maybe that doesn't go there since you keep pushing it in and it doesn't fit.	
18	12		do you want to tell me why this piece went there?	
18	12		ok. How should I put this piece.	
18	12		here like that?	
18	12		ok why does it goes like that?	
18	12		do you know?	
18	12		ok. Where should we put this piece.	
18	12	59100.0	ok, great.	
19	12	29460.0	So here is our first piece, can you tell me what to do with it?	
19	12			Uh, I think that goes right there.
19	12		Think that goes there?	
19	12		ok. And why do you think it goes there.	
19	12			because it's a corner piece.
19	12			because it's a corner piece and that's the only where we can put it because because these other corners can't fit it.
19	12		ok. And why, how do you know it's a corner piece.	
19	12			because because that corner's right there.
19	12		ok. And what do you think I should do with this piece.	
19	12			we should put that right there.
19	12		right here?	
19	12		ok, and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
19	12			because that hump and that red part I think it was part of the barn.
19	12		oh ok. And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
19	12			I think that goes right there.
19	12		you think that goes right here like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no, how should I fix it?	
19	12			you should turn it over a little bit.
19	12	33120.0	this way?	
19	12			yeah.
19	12		oh ok how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
19	12			because it was, nothing could connect with this.
19	12		oh ok . And what about this piece, can you tell where where we should put this one?	
19	12			we should put it right there.
19	12		right here like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no? ok. How should I fix it.	
19	12			you should turn it over.
19	12		turn it over this way?	
19	12			yeah.
19	12		ok and how'd you know it needed to go that way.	
19	12			because because I thought the cat goes right there.
19	12		oh. And how about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
19	12			hmm… I think that goes right there.
19	12		right here like this?	
19	12		ok and why do you think it goes there.	
19	12			because it's kind of like he's sitting down
19	12		oh ok. And what about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
19	12			hmm, I think that goes right there.
19	12		right here like this?	
19	12			yep.
19	12		ok and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
19	12			because the horse's eyes are right there.
19	12	36840.0	and what about this piece where should I put this one.	
19	12			um, that goes…
19	12			I think it goes
19	12		right here?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no? how could we tell that's wrong?	
19	12			because hmm.
19	12			because that's right there.
19	12		oh ok so what do you think we should do with this piece then.	
19	12		you think here like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no, ok, so what do you think we should do?	
19	12			we should flip it over.
19	12		flip it over like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no, hmm.	
19	12			think that goes… right there.
19	12		right here like this?	
19	12		do you think all the pieces that we have in right now are where they're supposed to be?	
19	12	40440.0	no? do you think one's wrong?	
19	12		if we can't find where this one goes?	
19	12		which one could be wrong do you think?	
19	12			hey…
19	12		hmm? Should we save this one for later do you think?	
19	12			maybe we should, maybe that, that piece doesn't fit anywhere.
19	12		you don't think it fits anywhere?	
19	12			except here.
19	12		except there?	
19	12			yeah because the corner's too big for this.
19	12		ok. Well what about if we do this.	
19	12			hmm, maybe that's
19	12		then where do you think that one goes.	
19	12		yeah ok.	
19	12		and how could you tell it goes there.	
19	12			because if we switched it, the cat was right there and we couldn't put that right here because so we switched these two and then and then this one went right there
19	12		ok. And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with that one?	
19	12	44100.0		I think that one goes right there.
19	12		oh ok that there?	
19	12		why did you think it went there?	
19	12			because the cat's, the rest of the cat was right there.
19	12		oh ok. And how about this piece where do you think this one should go?	
19	12			I think right there.
19	12		think here like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no? how could we tell that's wrong?	
19	12			because because the head is supposed to go on the top
19	12		oh ok. Alright I just need one of you guys to sib sit, cause she's just gonna do the questionnaires and the ## so	
19	12		ok so what should we do to fix it do you think.	
19	12			um I think the corner should go with this corner.
19	12		like this?	
19	12			yeah.
19	12		oh ok. And how'd you know it needed to go that way?	
19	12			because that part of this part that matches
19	12		oh ok. And what about this piece where should this one go.	
19	12	47700.0		right there.
19	12		ok. Like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no? how should I fix it?	
19	12			flip it over
19	12		over like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12			flip it again, do it again.
19	12		do it again? Ok.	
19	12		and how could you tell I put it in wrong	
19	12			because this, this was a side piece
19	12		oh ok. And how could you tell it's a side piece.	
19	12			because that side was right there.
19	12		oh ok. And what about this piece what should we do with this one.	
19	12			um that should go right there.
19	12		should go right here like this?	
19	12			no.
19	12		no? and how should I fix it?	
19	12			you should flip it around.
19	12		flip it like this?	
19	12			yeah.
19	12		ok and how'd you know I needed to do that?	
19	12			because the sheep's wool is right there.

19	12			right there.
19	12		right here like this?	
19	12			no, flip it over.
19	12		and how'd you know we needed to do that.	
19	12			because because the duckling's, the rest of the duckling's right there.

20	12			there.
20	12		right here like this?	
20	12		ok, and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
20	12			cause there's a piece of the barn.
20	12		oh cause it was the red piece of the barn? Ok.	
20	12		and how about this piece, where do you think this one goes.	
20	12		like this?

21	12			Because, because the pig! There's not enough space!
21	12		Oh, so what should we do with it?	
21	12		Do you think it goes there, or do we have to fix it?	
21	12			We have to fix it right here.
21	12		Ok, so it should go here like this?	
21	12			Mm-hm.
21	12		Ok. And what should we do with this piece?

21	12		Put it right here like this?	
21	12		Ok, and how'd you know it had to go there?	
21	12			Cause it doesn't match up with the head.
21	12		Oh, and how could you tell it wouldn't match with the head?	
21	12			Cause here, if I put the tail in the front it wouldn't match.
21	12		Oh, if you put the tail in the front it wouldn't match?	
21	12			See?

21	12			Hmm, maybe not.
21	12		Maybe not? Why don't you think it goes there?	
21	12			See?
21	12	42180.0	Oh, how can we tell it doesn't match there?	
21	12		What about it makes us tell that it can't go there?	
21	12			What's this can go there.
21	12		I don't know. Where do you think this piece goes?	
21	12		Do you have a guess?	
21	12		Think it goes there?	
21	12			No.
21	12		No? Oh.

21	12		Well, what about if we do this?	
21	12		Does that look right?	
21	12			Mm-hm.
21	12		Ok. How could we tell that it looks right?	
21	12		Now do you have a guess for where this piece would go?	
21	12			No!
21	12	46020.0	How could you tell it doesn't go there?	
21	12			See?
21	12		Oh, ok. And how can we tell it doesn't fit?	
21	12		What makes you think it doesn't fit?	
21	12		What do you see?	
21	12			I see this right here.
21	12		Oh, ok, and what is that.	
21	12			That's the rest of this.
21	12		Oh ok, so where do you think that piece should go?	
21	12		It doesn't go there. Where else could it go?	
21	12		Should we save it for later?	
21	12			Mm-hm.
21	12		ok, we can come back to that one.	
21	12		What about this piece, where should this one go?	
21	12		Can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
21	12			That, right here.
21	12		It goes here?	
21	12		That look right?	
21	12			No.
21	12		No? So how should we fix it do you think?	
21	12			Like this.
21	12		Oh ok, how'd you fix it?	
21	12		How'd you fix it, what'd you do to fix it?

21	12			Right here.
21	12		Right there?	
21	12		Ok. Does that fit there?	
21	12			Hmm. Think we should, see it later, just put off the puzzle for later.
21	12		Oh, ok, we should leave that piece for later?	
21	12			No, all, no, every- the puzzle!
21	12		Well, let's try to finish it.	
21	12			The puzzle, puzzle!

22	12	26580.0	Okay we're going to play a game with this puzzle, okay?	
22	12			Maybe that piece goes here.
22	12		You think so?	
22	12		You think it goes there?	
22	12			Try a different way.
22	12		Try a different way?	
22	12		That way?	
22	12		Okay why do you think it goes there?	
22	12			Because the edges work there.
22	12		Oh, okay, and where are the edges?	
22	12			Right here.
22	12		Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
22	12			You should put it right here see if it fits there.
22	12			It fits!
22	12		There you go, how can you tell it fits?	
22	12			That part's the horsey's tail.
22	12		You think so? How can we tell the piece fits there?	
22	12			Because it has part of the barn.
22	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece, where should we put this one?	
22	12			Try right here.
22	12	30300.0	Right here like this?	
22	12		That look right?	
22	12			No.
22	12		No? How should we fix it?	
22	12			Maybe like this.
22	12		There? How'd you know we had to put it there instead of where we had it?	
22	12			Because it fits.
22	12		Okay, how could you tell it fits?	
22	12			Because it's part of the horse.
22	12		Okay. And what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
22	12			Maybe put it right here, see if it fits.
22	12		Put it right here like this?	
22	12			No.
22	12		No? How could you tell it doesn't fit?	
22	12			Try like… that… um… maybe we're not ready for that piece yet?
22	12		We aren't? Okay.	
22	12		Do you have a guess where it could go?	
22	12		Where else could it go?	
22	12		Okay, how'd you know to try it there?	
22	12			Because that is the tail and that's the rest.
22	12		Oh, ok. Got it. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
22	12		Can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
22	12			Put it right here, see if it fits.
22	12	33780.0	Put it right here like this?	
22	12			No.
22	12		No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
22	12			Try it right here.
22	12		Right there, you think it goes there?	
22	12			Yeah.
22	12		What makes you think that?	
22	12			Because the edges fit.
22	12		Oh, okay. And what about this piece, where should this one go?	
22	12			How about right here.
22	12		Right here like this?	
22	12			No.
22	12		No? How should we fix it?	
22	12			Right here.
22	12		Oh, okay, how'd you that it would fit that way?	
22	12		How could you tell that I put it in wrong?	
22	12			Because it was facing this way.
22	12		Oh, okay, and how could you tell that was wrong?	
22	12			Maybe let's put it right here.
22	12		Oh, okay, how'd you know we had to do that?	
22	12			Because that's part of the horsey's mouth.
22	12		Oh okay, and what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
22	12			I don't think we need, are ready for this piece.
22	12	37500.0	We aren't, should we save it?	
22	12			Yeah.
22	12		Oh, but you think it might go there?	
22	12		What makes you think that?	
22	12			I think so.
22	12		What makes you think it goes there?	
22	12			Because that's the right way.
22	12		Okay. And what about this piece where should this one go?	
22	12			I don't know.
22	12		You don't know? Do you have a guess?	
22	12			It could go right here.
22	12			But it doesn't.
22	12			It goes right here.
22	12		Good job, and what made you think it might go there?	
22	12		What made you guess that it would go there?	
22	12			It has water but it doesn't go there.
22	12		Oh, ok.	
22	12			That's part of a sheep.
22	12		It is part of a sheep.	
22	12		What should we do with this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
22	12			Put it right here.
22	12		Put it right here like this?	
22	12			No.
22	12		No? How should we fix it?	
22	12		Where did that piece go?	
22	12	41340.0	Do you think that one's wrong, or do you think we have it in the right place?	
22	12			I think we have it in the right place but this goes on top.
22	12		Oh, you think that one goes on top?	
22	12			And I think we're not ready for that one yet.
22	12		Okay. So what should we do with this piece?	
22	12		Can you use your words and tell me what to do?	
22	12			Maybe put it in here.
22	12		Put it where.	
22	12			In here.
22	12		Oh.	
22	12			It fits.
22	12		It does fit, how can we tell it fits?	
22	12			Because…
22	12			That fits.
22	12		Yeah, how could you tell it would go there?	
22	12			That corn is on the floor.
22	12		It is on the floor, isn't it.	
22	12		And what should we do with this piece?

22	12			No.
22	12		No, how should we fix it.	
22	12		Put it that way, okay, how'd you know it would go that way and not the way that I put it in?	
22	12			Because that's the right way it's facing.
22	12	45720.0	Oh, okay, great job.	
22	12			And that's put together.
23	12	30960.0	Okay. So this one we're going to do a little differently, okay?

23	12		How could you tell?	
23	12			Because you're doing it like this.
23	12		Okay, and why is that wrong?	
23	12			Because this facing up and this supposed to be facing up and this supposed to be in the corner.
23	12		Oh, that's supposed to be in the corner? Okay.	
23	12		What should we do with this piece?	
23	12			Right here.
23	12	34740.0	Right here like this?	
23	12			No.
23	12		What should we do to fix it?

23	12			Because you were doing it like this.
23	12			The cat was facing this way.
23	12		Oh, okay. What about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12			Right here.
23	12		Right here like that?	
23	12			Yes.
23	12	38220.0	Oh okay, and how'd you figure that out?

23	12			I thought it goes here, but it goes there.
23	12		Okay, and why'd you think it went there?	
23	12			Because these two corners work the same, and these two corners look the same.
23	12		Oh, the corners look the same?	
23	12		Okay, what about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12			I don't know… here.

23	12			Nope. I'm going to put it in the right way.
23	12		Oh, and how'd you know that was the right way in	
23	12			Why is there water here?
23	12		I don’t know.	
23	12		How could you tell that I put it in the wrong way.	
23	12			Because this was facing up where the horse was.
23	12		Okay, and what's wrong with that?	
23	12			Because, I don't know.
23	12		You don't know?	
23	12		Okay. And what about this last piece, where should this one go.	
23	12			Here.
23	12		Here like this?	
23	12			I put it in.
23	12			I'll put it in the right way.

24	12			It should go right here.
24	12		Okay, like this?	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		And how'd you know it would go there?	
24	12			Because it's a corner.
24	12		Oh okay, and how could you tell it's a corner.	
24	12			Because it has a point.
24	12		Oh, okay I got it.	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		and what about this piece, where should we put this one.	
24	12			It goes right here.
24	12		Right here like this?	
24	12			Mm-hmm, uh… yeah!
24	12		What'd you do to fix it?

24	12			Oh, I don't know.
24	12		You don't know? Can you take a guess?	
24	12		Where do you think it should go?	
24	12			Hmm, right over here.
24	12		Here like this?	
24	12			No. I think it should be like this.
24	12		You think it should be like this?	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		Oh okay, and how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
24	12			Because it was upside down.
24	12		Oh okay so what did you have to do to fix it?	
24	12			Do it right side up so that up is down.
24	12		Oh, got it.	
24	12	49140.0	Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?

24	12		So can you take a guess where you think this piece could go?	
24	12			I don't think, I don't think so.
24	12		No, should we save it for later?	
24	12			No.
24	12		So should we save it?	
24	12			No.
24	12		So do you think you can find where it goes now?	
24	12			Right here.
24	12		Right here like this?	
24	12			No, this doesn't go there, silly.
24	12		How can you tell it doesn't go there?	
24	12		I thought you said it would go there.	
24	12			No, I can't figure it out.
24	12		Okay, we'll save it for later.	
24	12			No.
24	12			Doesn't go there.
24	12			This is a corner also.
24	12			Because it has a point.
24	12		And so where should we put it?	
24	12			It goes right there.
24	12		Oh, how do you know it has to go there?	
24	12			Because it's a corner.
24	12	52740.0	Oh, okay.	
24	12			I told you that.
24	12		Got it.	
24	12			My eyes are brown.

24	12		Okay, can you find where this piece should go?	
24	12			Right there.
24	12		Right here like this?	
24	12			Right in the middle.
24	12			Up, right side up.
24	12			Tada.
24	12		Oh okay, and how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
24	12			Because it was upside down.
24	12		Okay. And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
24	12			It should be right over there.
24	12		Right here like this?	
24	12			Uh, I don't see a cow spot.
24	12		So where do you, do you have a guess for where that could go?	
24	12			It could go right over here.
24	12		Right there?	
24	12			No, no, not there.
24	12			I see a little other spot.
24	12		Oh, okay so where do you think that piece could go then?	
24	12			A cow!
24	12			I don't see a cow.
24	12		So should we save it for later?	
24	12			No. I think there's a cow spot.
24	12	56460.0	Well we're not going to look at the picture, we're going to try to do it without the picture, okay?	
24	12			Okay.
24	12		So if you want you can make it	
24	12			Go right here.
24	12		What makes you think it goes there?	
24	12			Because it's a corner.
24	12			And it has a point.
24	12		Oh, got it.	
24	12			See that corner?
24	12		And why doesn't it go here?	
24	12			Because it there's no point right there.
24	12		Oh okay, got it.	
24	12		Okay and what about this piece where should this one go.	
24	12			I don't know.
24	12		You don't know? Do you have a guess where it could go?	
24	12			Yeah, it's a sheep piece.
24	12		So where do you think the sheep would go.	
24	12			Right there.
24	12		Right here like this?	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12			Oh, that doesn't fit.
24	12		How could you tell that doesn't fit?	
24	12			Because it's too wide and look right here.
24	12			But it is a corner.
24	12	59940.0	Okay, so where do you think it should go?	
24	12		We could save it.	
24	12			No.
24	12		Do you have a guess where it could go?	
24	12		Should we just make a guess and if it's wrong we can change it later?	
24	12			Nope.
24	12		No?	
24	12		Let's save it.	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		What about this piece, where should this one go?	
24	12			Oh, right here.
24	12		There?	
24	12			Nah.
24	12		No?	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		There we go, good job.	
24	12		Okay, what made you try it there first?	
24	12			Because I thought it goes there but it doesn't.
24	12	62760.0	Okay and how could you tell it didn't go there?	
24	12			Because there's no line.
24	12		Oh okay. So what about this piece, where should this one go?	
24	12			It should go right there.
24	12		It should go right here like this?	
24	12		Okay, and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
24	12			Because the chicken is on the cow's back.
24	12		And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
24	12			It should go right over here.
24	12		Okay, how'd you know it needed to go that way?	
24	12			Because it goes, it has one line.
24	12			And the mama duck's feet are right there.
24	12		Got it, and what about this piece where should this one go?	
24	12			It goes right there.
24	12		Goes right here?	
24	12			Yeah.
24	12		Kay how'd you know those pieces would match?	
24	12			Because they don't go together.
24	12			Look, a baby chick.
24	12		Yeah. So this piece, where does that one go now.	
24	12			It goes right here.
24	12	66060.0	Good job.	
25	12	31320.0	See, this is the next one.	
25	12		Yeah, ok but this is our first piece for the other puzzle, what should I do with it?	
25	12			Put it on the top.
25	12	35280.0	Okay, so where should I put it, can you show me?	
25	12			Right there.
25	12		Right here like this?	
25	12		Does that look right?	
25	12		Okay. And why do you think it goes there?	
25	12			Because you can't go put it down.
25	12		We can't? Why not? Why can't we put it down?	
25	12			Because the ###... The… the… if we don't… the pieces will fall out.
25	12		Oh, ok. So we should leave it here, or we should put it where it was? Where should we put it.	
25	12			Right here.
25	12		Right here like this? Ok.	
25	12		And what about this piece what should we do with this one?	
25	12		Oh, ok and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12			Because that opens up.
25	12		Because what opens up?	
25	12			The door.
25	12		Oh, the door opens up? Okay.	
25	12	38700.0	And what about this next piece what should I do with this one?	
25	12			Put it down here.
25	12		Down here like that?	
25	12			Yeah.
25	12		That look great?	
25	12			Put it over here like this.
25	12		Oh, ok and how'd you know it would go there and not where we had it?	
25	12		How'd you figure that out?	
25	12			Because we have to go there. ## put it away.
25	12			And no one could flip it over.
25	12		Oh, ok. Won't let you flip it over.	
25	12		What should we do with this piece.	
25	12		Right there?	
25	12			Yeah.
25	12		Oh and how did you know that piece would match there?	
25	12			Because it fits there.
25	12		But how did you know it'd fit there?	
25	12			Because no flip it over here.
25	12		Oh, ok.	
25	12			### be scared.
25	12		Ok so what about this next piece what should we do with that one.	
25	12			Put it right here.
25	12	42360.0	Right here? Like this?	
25	12			Pigs go oink oink.
25	12		Yeah, ok. So why'd you put that piece there, what made you put it there?	
25	12			You keep it there, not flip it over.
25	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
25	12			I knew where the head goes.
25	12		The head goes there?	
25	12			You can't ## flip it over.
25	12			Kinda scared of the dark. You have to stay out of the room.
25	12		Oh, ok.	
25	12			Kind of scared of the… ######
25	12		Yeah? How'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12		How'd you know we had to put it here?	
25	12			Because it has to go, to go
25	12		Because it has to go there?	
25	12			Yeah.
25	12		Ok.	
25	12		And what about that piece, where does that one go.	
25	12	45900.0		Right here.
25	12		Right there? Why do you think it goes there.	
25	12			Because… ### taken away.
25	12		Ok. And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
25	12			Here.
25	12		There like that?	
25	12			Here. Next to the cow here.
25	12		Next to the cow piece?	
25	12		Why do you think it goes next to the cow piece?	
25	12			Because ## should always take it apart.
25	12		And what about this piece, where should that one go.	
25	12			Right here.
25	12		Right there?	
25	12			There?
25	12		Hmm.	
25	12			It does go right here.
25	12		Yeah, I think it goes there. How'd you know it would go there?	
25	12		What made you try it there?	
25	12			No one.
25	12		No one?	
25	12			Yeah, tried it all by myself.
25	12		Yeah, but why'd you try it there all by yourself?	
25	12	49500.0	What made you think it would go there?	
25	12			The sun is out.
25	12		The sun's out? It is out.	
25	12		So you think these pieces go here or should we fix those?	
25	12			mmhmm. I think that this go there.
25	12		You think they go there? Ok.	
25	12		So what about this piece where should this one go?	
25	12		Oh, good job. How'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12		How'd you figure that out?	
25	12		Oh, and that one goes there?	
25	12		How'd you figure out that that piece went there?	
25	12			Because it don't attach the other way
25	12		Oh okay. And where should that piece go.	
25	12			Right here.
25	12		Right there?	
25	12	53400.0		Can we use the next piece of the…
25	12		Yeah. How'd you know that piece would go there?	
25	12			Because that's the cat.
25	12		That's the cat?	
25	12			Yeah.
25	12		Oh ok, so what about this piece, can I take a turn and you tell me where I should put this piece?	
25	12		Right there?	
25	12			Yeah.
25	12		Ok and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
25	12			Yeah give me the last piece.
25	12		The last piece? Here it is.	
25	12		How should that one go in?	
25	12			That.
25	12	55620.0	There we go, good job.	
26	12	33240.0	Well this one we're going to do a little differently, okay, we're going to play a game with it.	
26	12	36780.0	Okay, so here's our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
26	12			Put it there.
26	12		Right here? Ok. And how'd you know it would go there?	
26	12			Because of the example. I remember the example
26	12		Okay so what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12			Here.
26	12		Here like this?	
26	12			Nah!
26	12		No? What should I do to fix it?	
26	12			Put it here.
26	12		Here like this?	
26	12		That look right?	
26	12			No. That's…
26	12		Hmm. So how should we fix it.	
26	12		Where could we put it.	
26	12			I need the example.
26	12		Well let's see. Let's look at these pieces. How do you think they could fit together?	
26	12			Try both.
26	12		No? Let's see. Oh.	
26	12		How'd you know we had to put it that way?	
26	12			Because we see a little bit of the barn.
26	12		The barn? Ok. So here is our next piece, what should I do with this one?	
26	12	40620.0	Where should this one go?	
26	12			I want the example.
26	12		Well can you let's see. Think about it without the example, where could you put this one.	
26	12		Just look at the pieces.	
26	12		Do you have a guess for where this one could go?	
26	12			No.
26	12		You sure? Should we save it for later?	
26	12			Ah.
26	12		You think it should go there?	
26	12		That look right?	
26	12		Hmm, where could that piece go?	
26	12		Hmm? You have another guess where it could go?	
26	12			No I don't… have any guesses for the puzzle
26	12		Okay well we can save that piece for later.	
26	12		How about this piece where should this one go.	
26	12			I don't have a guess for it.
26	12		You don't? Are you sure? 	
26	12	44220.0	Where could that piece go?	
26	12			Maybe it goes…
26	12		Go there?	
26	12			Or… here.
26	12		There?	
26	12			Or here.
26	12		Oh, how'd you know it'd fit there?	
26	12			Because I see like boop.
26	12		What is that? What do you see?	
26	12			I don't know what that is.
26	12		You don't know? We'll wait and see.	
26	12		Okay, now, do you have a guess for where this one could go now?	
26	12		Where do you think this one could go?	
26	12			Don't know.
26	12		You don't know yet? Ok.	
26	12		How about this piece where should this one go.	
26	12		You don't have a guess yet?	
26	12			I don't have a guess.
26	12		Ok.	
26	12			I think that we're just flying through it.
26	12		Yeah? Where does this piece go?	
26	12	47520.0	Are you sure you don't know where this one goes yet? Take a good look at it.	
26	12		Oh! How'd you know to try it there?	
26	12			Because we see brown, brown brown edge.
26	12		Oh, ok.	
26	12		So what about this piece, do we have a guess for where this one could go yet?	
26	12		Oh, and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
26	12			Cause, pig, pig.
26	12		Ok. And this piece, do we know where this one goes yet.	
26	12		No.	
26	12		And what about this piece, do we know where this one should go?	
26	12		Right here, like this?	
26	12			No.
26	12		Like that?	
26	12		Where should that one go.	
26	12		Ok, how'd you know to try it there?	
26	12			Because brown, brown.
26	12		Browns match? Ok.	
26	12	51480.0	So what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12		Can you tell me where this piece should go?	
26	12		Keep these here.	
26	12		Where should this piece go?	
26	12		You don't know yet? Take a good look. Where do you think this piece should go.	
26	12		Can I try it? Can you tell me where I should try it?	
26	12		Here like this?	
26	12			No, like that.
26	12		Hmm… where else could we try that piece.	
26	12		Oh, how'd you know to try it there?	
26	12			Because… pig, pig pig pig.
26	12		Oh, ok. And this piece, do we know where this one should go yet?	
26	12		Not yet? Ok.	
26	12	55020.0	What about this one?	
26	12			That one give me an idea.
26	12		Yeah?	
26	12		Think it should go there?	
26	12			Go there, there…
26	12		Hmm. Where should we put that piece.	
26	12			Couple options.
26	12		Yeah.	
26	12			### right here?
26	12		Think it goes there?	
26	12			Here?
26	12			Is that right?
26	12		It might go there?	
26	12		Why do you think it goes there?	
26	12		What makes you think that?	
26	12			Ah, that?
26	12		Oh, I think that's right.	
26	12		How do we know that it goes there like that and not the other way.	
26	12		Not the way you had it.	
26	12		How do we know that this way looks better.	
26	12			There we go.
26	12		Oh, and how'd we know this piece had to go this way and not the other way around?	
26	12			Because there's a hole.
26	12	58560.0	Oh, ok.	
26	12		And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12		Can you use your words and tell me where you're putting it?	
26	12		Oh, and how'd you know it would match there.	
26	12			Because there's duck duck.
26	12		Oh ok. So what about this piece, can you use your words to tell me where to put this one? I want to take a turn.	
26	12		Right here like this?	
26	12			No, like this.
26	12		Oh, ok.	
26	12			Oh.
26	12			I think it's like this.
26	12		Oh okay, and how could we tell it had to go here and not here?	
26	12			Cause cow, cow.
26	12		Ok, and our last piece.	
26	12		Right here like this?	
26	12		Ok.	
26	12			Done, done!
26	12	60900.0	Good job.	
27	12	24960.0	But we're going to play a game with this one, ok? Whoops!	
27	12		Ok. So here is our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Right here, and how'd you know it would go there?	
27	12		How'd you figure that out?	
27	12			I don't know.
27	12		You don't know?	
27	12			No, I didn't

27	12			Um I know since they go match.
27	12		Oh, you make it match?	
27	12	28560.0	And what about this piece where does this one go	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Right here like this?	
27	12			No.
27	12		No?	
27	12			Like that.
27	12		Oh, ok what'd you have to do to fix it?	
27	12			You turn it around, see? And they'll match the piece.
27	12		Match the piece? Ok.	
27	12		And what about this piece where does this one go	
27	12			Right… right… this part.
27	12		Right here?

27	12		No?	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Oh, ok.	
27	12			She's jelly.
27	12		Oh, and what made you try it there?	
27	12		Why'd you think it would go there?	
27	12			I kinda guessed.
27	12			I couldn't change it!
27	12		You couldn't change it? Ok.	
27	12		What about this piece, can you tell me what to do with it?	
27	12			Right here!
27	12		Right here?	
27	12			Yeah.
27	12	32040.0	How'd you know those pieces would match?	
27	12			Oh, because I go my house and I figure my puzzles.
27	12		Oh, ok. And what about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
27	12			Um, right here.
27	12		Right here?	
27	12			Yeah.
27	12		Oh, how'd you know it had to go there? Huh?	
27	12			I don't know.
27	12		You don't know? Why didn't we wanna try it there?	
27	12		How'd you know it wouldn't go there?	
27	12			Go right here.
27	12			I didn't make this corner and then I make that corner.
27	12		Oh, make that corner and the other corner?	
27	12		What about this piece where should this one go?	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		right here? And how'd you know it had to go there?	
27	12			Because I, took the pieces and came the sides.
27	12		Oh, ok. And what about this piece, where should this one go?	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Right here like this?	
27	12			Oh, like that.
27	12		That?	
27	12		Oh, ok, and how'd you know it couldn’t go there?	
27	12			It doesn't shape like that.
27	12	35700.0	Oh, like what.	
27	12			###. Like the face, it go my house.
27	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece where should we put this one	
27	12			There.
27	12		Right here like this?	
27	12			No. Turn a little more.
27	12			Like that.
27	12		Oh, what'd you do to fix it?	
27	12			Cause it matches.
27	12		Matches? Ok.	
27	12		How could we tell it matches there?	
27	12			Because the black and the black.
27	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece.	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Right here like this?	
27	12			No.
27	12		No? how do we fix it.	
27	12			Gotta turn like this.
27	12		Turn it like that?	
27	12			No.
27	12		Ok how did we know it had to go that way?	
27	12			I can, because, under goes the way ### it goes, this and… it can't be backwards!
27	12		It can't be backwards? Ok.	
27	12			Right here.
27	12		Right here like this?	
27	12			No.
27	12		No? How do we fix it?	
27	12			You see ###!
27	12	39360.0	There we go, good job.	
28	12	37800.0	Ok so let me explain how we're going to do this puzzle, ok?	
28	12		Ok. So here is our first piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
28	12			You can put it right here if you want.
28	12		Right here like this? Ok.	
28	12		And why do you think it goes there?	
28	12			Because it's maybe top of the barn.
28	12		It's the top of the barn?	
28	12			No. We have to find out where this…
28	12		Can you use your words and tell me what to do with this piece?	
28	12		Put it here like this?	
28	12			Uh, no, turn it around.
28	12		No? Turn it around?	
28	12	41640.0		Yup.
28	12		Oh, ok.	
28	12			Doesn't match.
28	12		Doesn't match? So what should we do with it do you think.	
28	12			Maybe we could put it 
28	12			There's no more pieces.
28	12		So what do you think we should do with this one.	
28	12			Oh, I know. Maybe we should go like this.
28	12		Go like that? Ok why do you think those pieces go like that?	
28	12			Because they maybe match.
28	12		They maybe match? Ok	
28	12			Well we have to find out if they don't match, we have to start all over again.
28	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
28	12			Maybe we could put it right here.
28	12		Right here like this?	
28	12			Uh, no, like this.
28	12		Oh like that?	
28	12			Yep.
28	12		Ok why do you think it goes there?	
28	12			Because the bird maybe wants to go this way.
28	12	45060.0	Oh ok. So what about this piece, where should we put this one?	
28	12			I think we should put it right here.
28	12		Put it right here like this?	
28	12			Yup. But maybe like this.
28	12		Oh, like that? Ok. Why do you think it goes that way?	
28	12			Because maybe it wants to go this way to the barn.
28	12		Oh ok. And what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one.	
28	12			I think we should put it right here.
28	12		Right there?	
28	12			Yup.
28	12		Ok why do you think it goes there?	
28	12			Because it maybe matches.
28	12		Maybe matches?	
28	12			Uh, we have to start…
28	12		What about this one?	
28	12			Maybe goes right here but there's no room.
28	12		Oh ok.	
28	12			We have to take the barn away  this way
28	12		And this one too?	
28	12			and pick this.
28	12		Ok. So where are we putting that piece?	
28	12			I think…
28	12		Oh, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
28	12			Because they're the same size. Look.
28	12	48780.0		This piece is the same as this so you put them together and they match.
28	12		Oh ok, got it.	
28	12		Ok now what about these other pieces do we know where we should put those	
28	12			The pig maybe goes right here.
28	12		There? Oh ok. How'd you know to put it there?	
28	12			Because it matches.
28	12		Ok. What about that piece.	
28	12			Now maybe the duck goes here it doesn't match
28	12			The kitty goes… oh it's not part.
28	12		How do we know it doesn't match there?	
28	12			Because this goes like neeaaw and this only goes like neeaaw
28	12		Oh ok.	
28	12		What about this piece, do we know where this one could go yet	
28	12			I maybe you put it right here.
28	12		Oh ok how'd you know it had to go there.	
28	12			Because it's part of the barn.
28	12		Ok so what about these other pieces do we know where these should go yet	
28	12	52380.0		Oh maybe the kitty cat goes right here.
28	12		There? You think that fits?	
28	12			No.
28	12		Hmm should we wait on that one?	
28	12			Maybe we have to do a Thomas puzzle like at my home.
28	12		Well we're just going to do this puzzle ok?	
28	12		What about this piece where do you think this one goes?	
28	12			Oh, maybe here.
28	12		Maybe there?	
28	12			Nope.
28	12		No? Where else do you think it could go?	
28	12			Here. Hey.
28	12		What made you try it in all those places?	
28	12		What made you think it could go there in those places?	
28	12			Because they almost match.
28	12		Oh ok.	
28	12			Because this goes like neewwp and this goes like bzzuuut
28	12		Ok. But they don't match?	
28	12			No.
28	12	55860.0	Why not.	
28	12			Because it goes like bzzuut and this goes like zzzuuuuuu
28	12		Hm. Got it. Okay well what about if I put this piece here.	
28	12			Matches!
28	12		That matches. And what about if we put this piece, do you have an idea where this one could go now?	
28	12			Here.
28	12		There?

31	12			Put it right there.
31	12		Oh you think it should go here instead?	
31	12		That look right? Ok. Why do you think it goes here.	
31	12			I wanna see the puzzle.
31	12		You wanna see the puzzle? Ok.	
31	12		Well we're gonna try to do it without it, ok?	
31	12		So what made you think it might go there first.	
31	12			Yeah better puzzle because we see the same thing.
31	12		What about this piece where do we think this one should go.	
31	12			That's a sheep
31	12		It's a sheep? Where should we put the sheep?	
31	12			I don't know.
31	12	43380.0	You don't know? Do you have a guess?

31	12			There's where it goes right there.
31	12		That's where it goes? Ok.	
31	12		So what about this piece we had that piece in the wrong spot where should we try that do you think?	
31	12		You don't know? Should we save this one for later too?	
31	12		Ok. What about this piece, where should we try this one.	
31	12		Right here like this?	
31	12		No? How should we fix it.	
31	12		Oh, what'd you do to make it fit?	
31	12		How'd you make it fit?

31	12		Oh, ok how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
31	12		How'd you know?	
31	12		Oh, do you know where that one goes?	
31	12		Oh, what made you try it there?	
31	12			Because that's right where it goes.
31	12		That's where it goes? Ok.	
31	12		But how did you know that's where it goes.	
31	12		You knew right where to put that one, how'd you know?	
31	12			I know I put it in right.
31	12		Ok what about our last piece.	
31	12	51120.0	There we go we got it.

32	12		Ok, and why'd you move that piece?	
32	12			Because I thought that was going right there, I thought that piece was going right there.
32	12		Yeah? So why couldn't this piece stay here?	
32	12			Because I thought it was going right there but it couldn't fit.
32	12		Okay. Why can't it fit there?	
32	12			Because the cow's leg has to go back there.
32	12		Oh, the cow has to go back there? Ok.

33	12		Where do you think it could go?	
33	12		You don't know? Ok.	
33	12		Let's try the next one.	
33	12		What about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
33	12		With this one? You think those match?	
33	12		Like this? No?	
33	12		Ok, what should I do to fix it, how would they match.	
33	12	28980.0	Oh, like that? Ok.	
33	12		Does that match?	
33	12		Does that look right?	
33	12		No? ok well what looks wrong about that.	
33	12		How can you tell that's wrong?	
33	12		Ok, so what should we do to fix it do you think?	
33	12		Cause I think you're right, I think those pieces match.	
33	12		Hmm. Does it match like that?	
33	12		No? Ok let's see what about if we do this.	
33	12		That look good? Ok.	
33	12		So you have a guess where you think these pieces should go?	
33	12		Oh, you think they go here?	
33	12		Ok. What makes you think that?	
33	12		you don't know? You don't have a reason?	
33	12		You just guessing? Ok.	
33	12		That's fine to just guess for now.	
33	12		Where do you think this piece should go?	
33	12		You got it, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
33	12		Huh? You knew right where to put that one, how'd you know?	
33	12	32700.0	Ok.	
33	12		So what do you think about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
33	12		How'd you figure that one out?	
33	12		You don't know?	
33	12		You've gotta have a way, you knew right where to put these pieces.	
33	12		How do you know?	
33	12		You don't know? Ok.	
33	12		So should we leave these pieces here, these look good here?	
33	12		Ok. Well what about if we do this.	
33	12		Does that look good? Ok.	
33	12		and what about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
33	12		You don't know yet? Do you have a guess where it could go?	
33	12		Can you make a guess?	
33	12		Ok we can save it.	
33	12		What about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
33	12		It should go here like this?	
33	12		Oh, like that? Ok.	
33	12		Does that look like it matches?

33	12		Look like it matches there?	
33	12		Yeah? Hm.	
33	12	39600.0	I don't think that's quite right, maybe we should save this piece.	
33	12		Do you have another guess?	
33	12		hmm, does it match there?	
33	12		Should we come back to that piece?	
33	12		ok. What about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
33	12		You don't know? Should we make a guess?	
33	12		Oh, how'd you figure that piece out?	
33	12		How'd you know it would go there?	
33	12		You don't know?	
33	12		Was there something about that piece that made you think it would go there?	
33	12		What was it, can you tell me?	
33	12		ok.	
33	12		what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where you want to put it?

33	12		Hm. You think those pieces match?	
33	12		Why's that, what makes you say that.	
33	12	43740.0	Fit there?	
33	12		How can we tell it doesn't fit there?	
33	12		ok. Oh, you think that matches like that?	
33	12		hmm, should we come back to this one again?	
33	12		Those were good guesses though.	
33	12		Where do you think this one should go?	
33	12		There you go, how'd you figure that one out?	
33	12		Good job, you could figure that one out too?	
33	12		How'd you do that?	
33	12			The turkey was on there.
33	12		The turkey was on him? Ok.

33	12		Where should that one go?	
33	12		You don't know? Hm.	
33	12		Think it might go there?	
33	12	46980.0	Hmm. We can come back to that piece, you want to come back to it?	
33	12		Ok. Let's try our next one.	
33	12		where do we think this one should go?	
33	12		There we go, how'd you figure out it had to go that way? Huh?	
33	12		and this last piece.	
33	12		Oh, there we go, how'd you make that one fit.	
33	12	48960.0	Ok, great job.	
35	12	38160.0	So this puzzle we're gonna play a game with it, ok?	
35	12		Yeah. Well it's the same one it'll look the same.	
35	12		Ok so this is our first piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?

35	12		hmm? You knew right where to put that piece.	
35	12		How'd you know?	
35	12		Ok. So does this piece still look good here?	
35	12		Well let's see what about if we do this.	
35	12		does that look right? Ok.	
35	12		And I'm gonna move these pieces here.	
35	12		Ok. So what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
35	12		It should go here?	
35	12		That look right?	
35	12			Yeah.
35	12		Yeah?

35	12		Goes behind the horsey? Ok.	
35	12		Uh, so what about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
35	12	52560.0	Oh, so it should go here?	
35	12		But we've already got a piece here, what should we do with this piece then.	
35	12		Ok you think it should go like this?	
35	12		That look right?	
35	12		So what do you think we should do.	
35	12		Well what about if we move this piece.	
35	12		Now where do you think we should try this one	
35	12		There we go how could you tell that piece would go there?	
35	12		How'd you know that?

35	12	56100.0	Do you know yet?	
35	12		Where do you think it should go?	
35	12		If you're not sure we can come back to it, we can save it for later.	
35	12		Think it should go here like this?	
35	12		That look right there?	
35	12		Do you have another guess? Or should we save it for later?	
35	12			Need help.
35	12		Ok we'll save this one, ok, we'll come back to it.	
35	12		So what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?

35	12			I don't know.
35	12		You don't know? Should we save this one too?	
35	12	59100.0	So what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
35	12			I don't know.
35	12		You don't know? Ok we'll save that one too.	
35	12		What about this piece, where should we try this one?	
35	12			I don't know.

41	12		The face goes right here? Ok.	
41	12			And there's the sunshine.
41	12		The sunshine, yeah.	
41	12		So what about this piece, do we have a guess where this one could go yet?	
41	12			Mm.
41	12		Where do you think.	
41	12			I want to try.
41	12		You wanna try it? Where are we gonna try it.	
41	12			I try this
41	12		Does it go right there?	
41	12			It don't go right there.
41	12		How could we tell it doesn't go there?	
41	12			Yeah.
41	12		How could we tell that's wrong?	
41	12			Yeah.
41	12			I see the pieces, but
41	12		But they don't fit?	
41	12			I think we got I think we can't move these puzzles because this is in the way.
41	12		Ok.	
41	12	57720.0		But we don't have to move these puzzles we gotta wait for this one.
41	12		Wait for that piece? Ok.	
41	12		What about this piece you have a guess where this one should go?	
41	12		Where, where do you think it should go.	
41	12			This should go right here.
41	12		Right there?	
41	12			Or right here.
41	12			Or right… here.
41	12		Does it go there?	
41	12			Yeah. This one don't go right there.
41	12		It doesn't go there?	
41	12		How could we tell it doesn't go there?	
41	12			Well some pieces go right here because you like the pieces together
41	12		What about this piece where do you think we should try this one.	
41	12			We should try this one um we should
41	12		Right there?	
41	12			Um, I think it go right here.
41	12	61200.0	Goes there?	
41	12			Yeah, no.
41	12			It don't go right there.
41	12			I think it's… I think this don't go right here.
41	12		Ok we should save it?	
41	12			Some of these go right here
41	12		Yeah? Well what if we try this piece here?	
41	12		Does that work? Yeah.	
41	12		What about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where we should try it?	
41	12			It go with the cow.
41	12		Goes with the cow? So do you have a guess where it would go on the puzzle?	
41	12			Oh, I know.
41	12		Where.	
41	12			It go right here.
41	12		Oh, it goes there, how'd you know that piece would go there?	
41	12			I know it.
41	12		But how'd you know?	
41	12			I just try this one right there.
41	12		Yeah, ok.	
41	12		And I have an idea where this piece could go I think it goes there.	
41	12			Yeah
41	12		Does that look right?	
41	12			I think.
41	12			Where's this one?
41	12		So what about this piece, do you have an idea where this one should go?	
41	12			We gotta wait for this turn.
41	12		Ok. What about this piece?	
41	12	64680.0		I think it go right here.
41	12		Does it go here like this?	
41	12			No.
41	12			I think I try…
41	12			What's that noise?
41	12		That's the radiator I think.	
41	12		Over there.	
41	12		It's for the heat.	
41	12			The heat coming out.
41	12		Yeah.	
41	12		Ok so do you have another guess where that piece could go.	
41	12			I think it go right here but
41	12		You think it goes there?	
41	12			No.
41	12		No?	
41	12			It got two points on them.
41	12		Two points on it?	
41	12		So where do you think it should go?	
41	12			It should go, um, we gotta wait for this turn.
41	12		Wait for it too?	
41	12			It's supposed to be with the pig.
41	12	67980.0	Supposed to be with the pig?	
41	12			But I don't know where this go.
41	12		You don't know?	
41	12			Not go right here.
41	12		Why do you think it goes with the pig?	
41	12			Because I see the pig's whole body.
41	12		Oh, there we go.	
41	12		Good job, how'd you know that piece had to go like that.	
41	12			Because I saw his legs.
41	12		You saw his legs, ok.	
41	12		What about this piece, do you have a guess for this one yet?	
41	12			This one…
41	12		There you go.	
41	12		How'd you know that piece would go there?	
41	12			I see the cow whole body because
41	12		The cow's whole body?	
41	12			Go right…
41	12		What about this piece?	
41	12		Where should we put that one.	
41	12			Goes… hmm…
41	12			What, I don't know where this go.
41	12		I think it might go there.	
41	12			Think it go right…
41	12		Does it go right here?	
41	12			Think so.
41	12		Let's see what could we do to that piece to make it fit there.	
41	12			Yeah.
41	12			It got two points on there.
41	12		Two points on there too?	
41	12		Well what if we put those points like this.	
41	12		Will it fit like that?	
41	12			Yeah.
41	12		There we go.	
41	12		And what about our last piece.	
41	12	72840.0	There we go, good job.	
42	12	27720.0	We're gonna play a game with my friend puzzle, ok.	
42	12	31500.0	I'm only gonna do what you tell me so be sure to tell me, use your words ok?	
42	12		What do you-what should I do with this one?	
42	12			Mm, put it up in the sky.
42	12		Up in the sky? Like here?	
42	12		Yeah?	
42	12		Scoot it over, ok.	
42	12		What about this one? Where should I put it?	
42	12		Can you tell me with words?	
42	12			Right here the barn goes barn.
42	12		Ok.	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12		Now where should this one go.	
42	12			Oh that's where the horsey goes.
42	12		So where should I put it?	
42	12			I think by the horsey.
42	12		Where by the horsey?	
42	12			Look at that. Right there.
42	12		You want me to try right there?	
42	12		Like that?	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12		Ok. How about this, where should this go?	
42	12			I think… the horsey goes there… ##
42	12			Wait a second back there?
42	12		Try it back there?	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12			Ah, there.
42	12	35220.0	Like that?	
42	12			Yes that's it.

42	12			That's so… I see the piggy. Where's the pig?
42	12			Where is that piggy?
42	12			Oh, wait a second.
42	12		Where should I put this piece?	
42	12		See it?	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12		Where do you think I should try it?	
42	12		I can try it anywhere, where do you want me to try it?	
42	12			I'm thinking here.
42	12		Here?	
42	12			Here.
42	12		Like that?	
42	12			No.
42	12		No? How?

42	12			Turn.
42	12	38580.0	Turn? Ok like this?	
42	12			The other way.
42	12		Like this?

42	12		No, hmm.	
42	12		Do you have another idea?	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12		Where's your other idea where I can put the piggy?	
42	12		It didn't fit there, remember?	
42	12			Yeah I remember.
42	12		Do you want me to try to just put it there for now?	
42	12		We can fix it later, ok?	
42	12		How about this, where should this go?	
42	12			Oh, wait a pig?
42	12			Oh, look at that pig.
42	12			Do you think it should go by the pig?
42	12		By the pig?

42	12		Like that?	
42	12			No.
42	12			Wait a second.
42	12		What?	
42	12			That's a part of a horsey.
42	12		Ok so where should I put it then?	
42	12			I think there.
42	12	42180.0	You think here?	
42	12			Yeah right there.
42	12		There we go.	
42	12			There we go.
42	12		Ok where should this one go then.	
42	12			I think right the pig there?
42	12		Right there?

42	12			Right, uh, like right there.
42	12		Like right here?	
42	12	45780.0		We can fix it later.
42	12		Fix it later? Ok.	
42	12		Where do you think this guy goes.	
42	12			Oh, that's something like where that cow goes.
42	12		Oh, really?	
42	12			Yeah.

42	12		Like that?	
42	12			Oh.

42	12		Turn it around? Like this?	
42	12			Yeah.
42	12		Oh, wow ok.	
42	12		Then let's try to fix this one, where does this one go now.

42	12	49380.0	Right there?	
42	12		Oh, nice.	
42	12		Ok, and what about this guy, where does he go.	
42	12			Oh, I think there.

44	12	34560.0	this is our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it? Where should we put it? Put it right here like this?	
44	12			uh-huh
44	12		how did you know it had to go there? 	
44	12			###
44	12		because how? How did you figure it out? You knew right where to put that one how did you know?	
44	12			###
44	12		because how? Was there something about that piece that told you it had to go there? What was it? What was it about that piece? Hmm?	
44	12	37080.0	ok, what about this piece where should we try this one? Can you use your words and tell me? Where should we put?	
44	12		like this? No? how do we fix it? What should we do? Can you use your words? What were you just doing with your fingers?	
44	12			there
44	12		hmm? Here? Ok, what should we do with this part? Oh it should go there like this? How could you tell I put it in wrong? I put it in wrong how could you tell? Hmm? How could you tell we had to fix that piece	
44	12			*noises*
44	12		hmm? You figured it out pretty fast how did you figure it out?	
44	12	40440.0	what about this piece? How did you know where to put that one? Hmm? What's that? What were your just pointing to? How could you tell this piece was a match? How could you tell? 	
44	12			they go together
44	12		they go together? How did you know they go together? Do you know?	
44	12	42600.0	Ok, what about this piece? Can you use your words and tell me where to try it?	
44	12			umm
44	12		right here? like that? no? hmm, how else could we try it? Well, should we try it somewhere else? Where should we try it? Here? No? how can you tell it doesn't fit? 	
44	12			because
44	12		oh? What's that? Why is that wrong? 	
44	12			because
44	12		you're right it shouldn't go there because of that, what is that?	
44	12			horse
44	12		a horse? Ok so what should we do with the horse? Where should it go? Oh right here like this? No? how do we fix it to make it fit?  Can you use your words and tell me?

44	12		which way? This way ? ok how'd you, how could you tell we had to put it that way	
44	12			it was wrong
44	12		it was wrong? How could you tell it was wrong? Do you know? How could you tell? You figured it out though, how did you figure it out?	
44	12	47280.0	ok ready for the  next piece? Where should we try tis one?  	
44	12			###
44	12		right here like this? No? how should we fix it? 	
44	12			this way
44	12		this way like this? That's still wrong? How an we tell its wrong?	
44	12			###
44	12		oh? How could you tell it had to go there? Hmm? How'd you figure that out? You were right, how'd you figure it out? 	err
44	12		what made you try it here?	
44	12	50580.0	ok, what should we do with this piece? Oh wow how'd you know that piece had to go there?	
44	12			the face
44	12		the face? Oh ok cool.	
44	12	51420.0	what about this piece where should we  try that one? Good job, how'd you know that piece had to go there? How could you tell? You knew right where to put that piece how did you do that? Was there something about that piece that told you that it had to go there? what was it?	
44	12	53280.0	ok, what about this piece where should we try this piece	
44	12			umm
44	12		here like this? No? how do we fix it can you use your words? 	
44	12			this, this way
44	12		this way like this no? which way?

44	12		no? how can we tell that's wrong? 	
44	12			because
44	12		because what's that what are you pointing to? So  what could we do to fix it do you think	
44	12			this way
44	12		this one? That work? No? where should we put it? Right here? No? where else could we try it? Any other ideas?  What about if we try it here? That work?	
44	12	57180.0	ok what about this piece?  Where could we try that one?  You got it good job how could you tell it would go there? 	
44	12			the chicken's eye
44	12		the chicken's eye ok	
44	12	57840.0	what about this piece? Could you try this one? Like this? 	
44	12			no
44	12		no? how  do you know it's wrong? How could you tell? 	
44	12			because  
44	12		that's wrong ok, so what could we do to fix this piece? 	
44	12			this way
44	12		like this? 	
44	12	58920.0	ok, and what about this piece? You got it good job. 	
45	12	30120.0	ok so this is our first piece where do you think we should put it? 	
45	12			hmm, maybe here? 
45	12		there we go, how'd you know it would go there? 	
45	12			because it was a corner and there and how would a barn-house be right in the middle? 
45	12		oh, ok, how could you tell it was a corner? 	
45	12			cause the there's no, there's no umm like edge and edge but there's only 2 edges
45	12		two edges ok	
45	12	31560.0	what about this piece? 	
45	12			umm
45	12		could you use your words and tell me? 	
45	12			there
45	12		like that? 	
45	12			no like
45	12		oh ok  what did you just do? Could you use your words and tell me what you just did to fix it? 	
45	12			aah
45	12		how'd you fix it? How could you tell I put it in wrong? 	
45	12			cause  the edge here wasn't, wasn't matching with this edge, 'cause you wanna match like put this edge 
45	12		oh so you have to match the edges? 	
45	12			yeah
45	12	34020.0	what about this piece where do you think this should go? 	
45	12			that's not a edge, maybe down here? 
45	12		down here like this, oh ok, how could you tell I had to fix that piece	
45	12			umm, 'cause this wasn't matching  'cause the color also wasn't matching with the color. This is brown and this was brown but that wasn't. this is white, you had it sideways. 
45	12		oh ok I had it sideways. 	
45	12			and that was sideways
45	12	35940.0	yeah, ok what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
45	12			hmm, aah here
45	12		here like this? No how do we fix it?	
45	12			the edge straight with the edge
45	12		the edge straight with the edge, like that? ok	
45	12	36660.0	and what about this piece	
45	12			umm, maybe down here
45	12		down here like this? 	
45	12			no
45	12		no? how do we fix it? 	
45	12			turn that around 
45	12		turn it around like this? That work?	
45	12			no
45	12		no? so what should we do to fix it do you think?	
45	12			aah, hmm  maybe try it up here
45	12		try it up here like that? Ok how did you know it had to go there? 	
45	12			cause it wasn't right side up 
45	12		and what made you try it there first? 	
45	12			umm cause I didn't know which was the top so I just wanted to see so then the corner was upside down so
45	12		oh the corner was upside down. Ok .	
45	12	39480.0	what about this piece? 	
45	12			umm, match the edge with the edge
45	12		match the edge with the edge like that?	
45	12			yeah
45	12		how do you know it had to go there	
45	12			cause there was corn and this one is missing a little green and this one is missing a face and the edge
45	12	40620.0	what about this piece? 	
45	12			umm, hmm, well there's two corners, but that is a corner so maybe we try it down here
45	12		like this? No? how should we fix it?	
45	12			umm wait, maybe here
45	12		here like this? 	
45	12			yeah
45	12		that work? No? so what should we do to fix it? 	
45	12			hmm, we missing something? 
45	12		I don't think so. Well it won’t match there. Where else could it go?	
45	12			hmm, maybe try to figure out how that goes in this one?
45	12		how did you know that was a corner piece?	
45	12			cause it had two edges like these
45	12		two edges like those ok	
45	12	44220.0	and, what about this piece?	
45	12			umm, hmm, it’s a corner so maybe
45	12		corner so it goes here. 	
45	12			er, no like 
45	12		how can we fix it? Ok how could you tell that piece was in wrong? 	
45	12			cause there  was grey and that had this connector pointed down here
45	12	45600.0	oh the connecter was pointed down? How about this piece? 	
45	12			*noises* somewhere here? 'cause it has a little pink
45	12		cause it has pink, ok, we try it there? No?

53	12			I think it could go right here.
53	12		Go right here like this?	
53	12			Yeah.
53	12		Ok.	
53	12		Why do you think it goes there?	
53	12			Because it has this right here.
53	12		What's that?	
53	12			A corner piece
53	12		A corner piece.	
53	12		How can you tell it's a corner piece?	
53	12			Because it has this.

53	12		What should we do to fix it?	
53	12			Yeah, I can fix it
53	12		How'd you fix it?	
53	12		What did you do?	
53	12			Flipped it.
53	12		Flipped it?	
53	12		Ok, how'd you know you had to flip it?	
53	12			Because if it don't fit this way, then you have to flip it.
53	12			Maybe it could go over here.
53	12		Oh	
53	12		Why'd you think it went there?	
53	12			Maybe because other pieces could go here so it can't just go like that
53	12			And where's the face?
53	12		Yeah.	
53	12		Ok.	
53	12	37800.0		
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12		Where should we try this one?	
53	12		Can you use your words and tell me where?	
53	12			I think it could go all the way at the bottom right here
53	12		Where?	
53	12		Right here at the bottom?	
53	12			No
53	12			Maybe it fits right here
53	12		Oh.	
53	12		How'd you know it had to go there?	
53	12			Maybe because I spied this and then I had to take a look and I took from here and put right here
53	12		Oh ok.	
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12		Can you tell me what I should do with it?	
53	12			Hmm
53	12			Maybe it could go right here
53	12		Right here like this?	
53	12			Maybe no
53	12		How can you tell it's wrong?	
53	12			Because where's the beak?
53	12		Oh ok.	
53	12		So what should we do to fix it, do you think?	
53	12			Should put it over here
53	12		Oh	
53	12			Here
53	12		How could you tell it might go there?	
53	12			Because I looked at this and this and this and this so I found the place where it could go
53	12		Oh ok.	
53	12	41100.0	So what about this piece?	
53	12		Where do you think we should try this one?	
53	12			Maybe over here
53	12		Over here like that?	
53	12			No
53	12			Like maybe this way
53	12		That way?	
53	12			No
53	12		How can you tell that's wrong?	
53	12			*laughing* Because there's no face and the butt goes over here
53	12		Oh ok.	
53	12		But why did you think it might go this way?	
53	12			Maybe it could go over here
53	12		Oh	
53	12		Why do you think it goes there?	
53	12			Because I saw the corner piece
53	12		The corner piece?	
53	12			This
53	12		Oh ok.	
53	12		And what tells you it's a corner piece again?	
53	12			Because it has this
53	12			Straight
53	12		Straight	
53	12			That's what my mom told me always
53	12		Yeah	
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12		Where do you think we should try this one?	
53	12			I think it could go right this one this one
53	12			This way, this way
53	12		This way?	
53	12			No.
53	12		No?	
53	12			I fixed that.
53	12		Oh ok	
53	12		So I put that one in wrong	
53	12		How could you tell?	
53	12			Because you did it wrong!
53	12		Yeah?	
53	12		How was it wrong, though?	
53	12	44820.0		because this wasn't supposed to go over here
53	12			because this doesn't look like brown and this doesn't look like over here
53	12		Oh ok	
53	12		Got it	
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12		Where do you think we should try this one?	
53	12			Hmm
53	12			I think right here
53	12		Right here like this?	
53	12			Umm no
53	12		No?	
53	12			Maybe like this
53	12		Like that?	
53	12		Hmm	
53	12		What makes you think it might go there?	
53	12			Maybe because it goes right here
53	12		Yeah?	
53	12			Yeah
53	12			Maybe it could go, maybe it could go like this way?
53	12		That way?	
53	12			No
53	12			Take this one out
53	12		Yeah?	
53	12		We should save that for later?	
53	12			Mm-hmm
53	12			Until we find the right place for that one
53	12		Ok.	
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12		Where should we try this one?	
53	12			Hmm
53	12			I think I saw the line over here
53	12		You think you saw the line there?	
53	12		Like that?	
53	12			No
53	12	48600.0	No?	
53	12			Maybe we can move it over here
53	12		Oh	
53	12		How'd you know that piece would go there?	
53	12			Because *noises*
53	12		What did you just point to?	
53	12		Can you use your words and tell me what you just did with your fingers?	
53	12			Because this had the cat's body and the sides and the horse's leg
53	12			I mean the pony's leg
53	12		Ok	
53	12		Do we have a guess for this piece yet?	
53	12			Hmm
53	12			Let me see
53	12			Maybe over here
53	12		Right here?	
53	12		Like that?	
53	12			No
53	12			Still save him for later
53	12		Ok	
53	12		How could you tell it doesn't go there?	
53	12			Maybe because it doesn't have it
53	12			Let me try again
53	12			I don't know
53	12		Ok	
53	12		What about this piece?	
53	12			Maybe it could go down here
53	12			Right here
53	12		Right here like that?	
53	12			No
53	12		No?	
53	12	52200.0		Put the pig's face down here
53	12		Oh	
53	12		How'd you know it had to go there?	
53	12			Because I need to find the right place for it
53	12		Ok	
53	12			But you didn't look
53	12		Ok	
53	12		And how could you tell it didn't go there?	
53	12			Maybe because you fit it wrong
53	12		Mm-hmm	
53	12			And I tried to get it and I took and I tried to get it
53	12			But it worked so maybe I found this and I put this
53	12		Ok	
53	12		And what about this piece?	
53	12		Do we have a guess for this one yet?	
53	12			Let me see
53	12			Nope not yet
53	12		Not yet?	
53	12			Hold on
53	12			Let me see that one again
53	12			I think
53	12			No
53	12		Ok	
53	12		What made you try it in those two places?	
53	12			Maybe because it has black
53	12		Mm-hmm	
53	12			*gasp*
53	12			hang on
53	12		What?	
53	12			Aah no!

53	12			Right here
53	12		Right there?	
53	12		Ok	
53	12	55800.0	Why do you think it goes there?	
53	12			Because it goes here
53	12			The pig's body
53	12			And here and the chicken
53	12		Do you have a guess for this one yet?	
53	12			Let me see
53	12		Ok	
53	12		You have to use your words and tell me where to put it

53	12		You think it goes like that?	
53	12			Yeah
53	12		Oh!	
53	12		How'd you know to try it there?

53	12		you flipped it?	
53	12		ok	
53	12		How did you tell you had to flip it?

53	12		OK	
53	12		And what about our last piece?	
53	12		Where should we try this one?

81	12			###
81	12	40080.0	ok, let's leave it there. What about this piece what should I do with this one? You think these go together?	
81	12	41040.0	what should we do, let's try these later, what should we do with this one? 	
81	12			right there
81	12		right where? 	
81	12			right there
81	12		right here? I don't know if that works, where else could we try it? 	
81	12			right there
81	12	42300.0	there we go. What about this piece?	
81	12			here
81	12		where does that one go? 	
81	12			right here
81	12	43500.0	ok, let's try this one again, where should we try this? 	
81	12			there
81	12	43860.0	ok, where should we try this one? 	
81	12	44160.0	I don't know if it fits there, try it here.	
81	12	44760.0	where should we try this one?	
81	12			right there
81	12		I don't think it fits there, how else could we try it? 	
81	12			right there
81	12	45480.0	try it here. What about this one? Where does this one go?	
81	12			it just go here
81	12	46020.0	what about the last on? Let's try it a different way. There we go. 	
82	12	26880.0	so what should I do with this piece?  Put it here? And why does it go here?

82	12		oh, the skin matches that? Ok, 	
82	12			cause that's the hair and that's the tail
82	12		oh so you think they go together? You wanna try them like that? Like that? Do they fit? How should I change it? 	
82	12			I can't get it
82	12		you can't get it? Should we try something else? Should we try it with any of these other pieces? No? ok, 	
82	12			cause it does
82	12	33120.0	what about this piece? Right here? And how do you know this goes there?

82	12	37860.0	ok, where should we try this one? Here? Why do you think it goes here?	
82	12			because that one goes there and then this one too
82	12		oh cause that one's open and that one's open? Doesn't seem like it quite fits, where else can we try it? Here like that?	
82	12	39180.0	ok, what about this one? Where?	
82	12			right there
82	12		right here? Like this?

82	12			because,
82	12		how'd you know that piece would go there? 	
82	12	41640.0	and this one didn't quite fit, should we  try it somewhere else?	
82	12			*whispering* it matches to the cow
82	12		matches to the cow? Alright let's work on this one later. 	
82	12	42180.0	where should I try this piece? And how did you know it would go there? 	
82	12			because it does
82	12	42780.0		let's try this piece. 
82	12		how'd you know that?	
82	12			because it does
82	12		alright what about this? And how'd you know it would go there? 	 
82	12			because it's by the duck
82	12	43500.0	it's by the duck, ok, what should we do with the last one?	
82	12			will you help me?
