2	12		Yes. 
2	12	How did you know it would go there?	
2	12		Because it doesn't fit there so it goes there. 
2	12	How did you know that it wouldn't fit there? 	
2	12		Because it doesn't have that. 
2	12	Oh, ok. What about this piece? Where should I out this one?

2	12		Ok. And why'd you have me put it there first? Why did you thinki
2	12	Ok. And why'd you have me put it there first? Why did you thinki it would go there? 	
2	12		Because that was there but then this didn't go in there and realized this didn't have the edge
2	12	Oh. Ok. And what about this piece? Which way does it	
2	12		Right there. 
2	12	Right here like that? 	
2	12		No.

2	12	Here like that?	
2	12		Yes. 
2	12	Ok good job. We finished the whole thing. 	
3	12	Ok. Now are you ready to try our next one?	
3	12		I want the animal one. The farm one. 
3	12	Ok. Yeah. So the way we're going to do this is we're going to play a game with it. Ok?	
3	12	I'm going to scoot over closer to you

3	12	Right here like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? 	
3	12		No. Right here
3	12	Ok. How did you know it went there instead of there? 	
3	12		Because
3	12	How'd you know that?	
3	12		Because I know that it goes right there
3	12	Ok. So what should we do with this next piece? Can you tell me what to do with it?	
3	12		We can put it right here. 
3	12	Right here like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should we fix it?	
3	12		Like this. 
3	12	Like that?Does that work like that?	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? So where should we put it? 	
3	12		We need the horse piece. 
3	12	Wait. We're going to do this piece first though. Where should we put that one? 	
3	12	Where do you think that one fits? 	
3	12		Right here.
3	12	Right there like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? 	
3	12		Right here
3	12	Like that? 	
3	12		Yeah. 
3	12	Yeah? Ok. And what should we do with this piece? 	
3	12		Put it down here.
3	12	Put it down there. Like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should we fix it?	
3	12	How'd you know those two pieces went together? 	
3	12	Huh? How'd you know that?	
3	12		Because I knew that
3	12	But how'd you know it? 	
3	12		Because it goes right there
3	12	Ok.	
3	12		Together.
3	12	Ok. And should we keep those pieces there?	
3	12		Yeah. 
3	12	Both of those? Ok. 	
3	12	And what should we do with this piece?	
3	12		Hmmm
3	12	Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
3	12	Here like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should I fix it? 	
3	12		You can put it right here. 
3	12	How'd you fix that one? How'd you match those two together. 	
3	12		Umm… I made them together.
3	12	Yeah? 	
3	12	How did you know we need to move those? Huh?	
3	12		Because I know to put them right there
3	12	Ok.	
3	12	And where should we put this piece?	
3	12		Mmm.
3	12	Here like this?	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should we fix it?	
3	12		We can put it right here. 
3	12	Right there?	
3	12	Does that work? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? So where should we put it do you think?	
3	12	Right here? Ok. 	
3	12	And how about this piece? Where does this one go? 	
3	12	Here like that? How'd you know those two pieces would fit together? 	
3	12		Cause I know that they fit together. 
3	12	But how? How could you tell. 	
3	12		Cause I know how fix them 
3	12	Ok. So where should I put this piece? 	
3	12	Here like this? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	So how should we fix it do you think? 	
3	12	Here like this?	
3	12		No.
3	12	What do you think we should do? 	
3	12		I think it goes right here. 
3	12	Right there?	
3	12		I think it goes right here. 
3	12	Like that? 	
3	12		I think it goes right here. 
3	12	How'd you know you had to put it that way? 	
3	12		Because I know that I can put it right there. 
3	12	And why did you change that piece? 	
3	12		Cause it goes right there. 
3	12	Ok. What should we do with this piece? 	
3	12	Here like this?	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should I fix it? 	
3	12		We shoul put it in like that. 
3	12	Ok. How did you know it needed to go like that and not the way I put it? 	
3	12		Because I knew
3	12	You knew. 	
3	12	What about this piece? Where should this one go? 	
3	12	Like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? How should we fix it?	
3	12	Did that work like that? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No? So how should, where should we put it? 	
3	12	How'd you know to try that there? 	
3	12	Huh?	
3	12		Because I knew it would belong there. 
3	12	Ok. And what should we do with this piece? 	
3	12	Can you show me what to do? 	
3	12	Put it right here like this?	
3	12		No
3	12	No? How should I fix it? 	
3	12		Do right here. 
3	12	Oh. Ok. So How was it wrong the way I put it in? How'd you know it was wrong?  	
3	12		Because it was backwards
3	12	Now what should I do with this piece? 	
3	12	Here like this? 	
3	12		No. 
3	12	No?	
3	12		Like this. 
3	12	How'd you know to fix that?	
3	12		Because it was backwards too. 
3	12	What should I do with this piece? 	
3	12	There we go. All done.	
3	12		Can we do it again? 
3	12	We're going to go play puzzles with your mom. 	
4	12	We're going to do one more ok? 	
4	12	But this one we're going to do a little differently.	
4	12	So, I'm going to show youhwo to play a game with the puzzle, ok?	
4	12	I'm going to scoot over.	
4	12	Ok. The way this game works is I have the puzzle pieces stacked, ok? And what we're going to do is you're going to tell me where to put the pieces and I'm going to put them in, ok?	
4	12	And this is what the puzzle is going to look like when we're all done. So take a nice good look at it.	
4	12	Ok. So make sure to use your words because I’m only going to do with the pieces what you tell me to do. 	
4	12	Can you tell me what to do with this piece? 	
4	12	Can you use your words and tell me? 	
4	12		Put it right there
4	12	Put it right here like this? Ok. 	
4	12	What about this piece? Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
4	12	Can you use your words and tell me? 	
4	12		That doesn't go there. 
4	12	That doesn't go there?So, where hould we put it?	
4	12		It goes here.
4	12	Right there? How'd you know those two pieces would go together?  	
4	12	How'd you figure that out? Huh?	
4	12	You don't know? Can you tell me where to put that piece? 	
4	12		That goes down here on the bottom 
4	12	On the bottom? How'd you know that? 	
4	12	You don't know? How about this piece? Where do that one go?	
4	12		It goes like this right here. 
4	12	Right there? How'd you get that to fit? 	
4	12	Huh? You don't know? 	
4	12	Where's that piece go? 	
4	12	You think it goes there? 	
4	12	Ok. How about this next piece? Where does that one go?	
4	12	How'd you figure out it went there?	
4	12	You don't know? You have to know. You're figuring all these pieces out. How are you doing it? 	
4	12	You don't know? Ok. Where does this piece go? 	
4	12		###
4	12	Ok. You don't know where it goes? 	
4	12	Ok. So you think the pieces we have in right now look good? 	
4	12	Those all look good? Ok. 	
4	12	So what about this piece? Where doe it go? Can you tell me where it goes? Where do you think it goes?	
4	12	Oops. Here. There we go. 	
4	12	How'd you know those two pieces would match?	
4	12	You don't know? 	
4	12	What are you going to do with that piece? 	
4	12		It goes here. 
4	12	It goes there? 	
4	12	Ok. So if it fits there, do you think all these are right where they are? 	
4	12		Yeah. 
4	12	Yeah? 	
4	12		But this is supposed to go right here. 
4	12	Right. I think you're right. So what should we do with these pieces to make that one fit right there?	
4	12	Is there something we can do with these? 	
4	12	What'd you just do? How'd you make that fit? What did you do?	
4	12		Moved it. 
4	12	You moved it over? You did, didn't you? 	
4	12	Can you find where that piece goes? 	
4	12	How'd you know that piece went there? 	
4	12	Can you find where that one goes now? 	
4	12	You think it goes there?	
4	12		This goes here
4	12	Yeah. So how did you know it didn't go there? 	
4	12	You don't know? 	
4	12	Where does that piece go? 	
4	12	There you go. How'd you get that piece to fit?	
4	12	Oh. I think you are pushing on the wrong spot.  	
4	12	There you go. Good. 	
4	12	Now I wanna try one. Can youtell me where I should put it? Can you use your words and tell me where to put this one? 	
4	12		###
4	12	Right there? How'd you know it would go there? 	
4	12	Huh?	
4	12	There we go. Good Job. You finished the whole thing. 	
5	12	Ok. We have one more puzzle to do, ok? 	
5	12	This one we are going to do a little differently,ok. This one we're going to play a game with it. 	
5	12	So, I'm going to scoot over. 	
5	12	Ok. So, in this game, I have the puzzle pieces stacked ok? And what we're going to do is you're going to tell me where to put the puzzle pieces and I'm going to put them in, ok? 	
5	12	But you gotta make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok? And this is what the puzzle will look like when we're all done. Ready to statrt> 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	Ok. 	
5	12	So can you tell me what I should do with my first piece? 	
5	12		Oh. I think it should go right here. 
5	12	Like that? 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	Ok. 	
5	12	And why did you think it should go there? 	
5	12		Because, ah, on that puzzle it shows it should goes over there. 
5	12	Ok. But we're not going to look at this one, ok? Try to do it without looking ok? 	
5	12	Ok. So how about this piece? Where should this one go? Can you tell me where it goes? 	
5	12	Right here, like that? 	
5	12		No
5	12	No?	
5	12		It ###
5	12	How should we fix it? 	
5	12	Does it fit there? 	
5	12		I think, I know
5	12	Why'd you move that piece? 	
5	12		Because it's on the middle one.
5	12	Hmm. 	
5	12		I Ithink it goes… here
5	12	How'd you know to try it there? 	
5	12		Because, it's umm, you know. Because it's part of the farm .
5	12	Ok. And how about this piece? Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
5	12		Put it right there. 
5	12	Right here, like this? 	
5	12	Why'd you try it that way? 	
5	12	How'd you know to try those two pieces?	
5	12		Because see, it's part of the… it's part of the legs
5	12	Parts of the legs of the horse. Ok. 	
5	12	Can you tell me what to do with this piece? 	
5	12		It goes in.. It goes right there. 
5	12	Goes right there like this ? Like that? 	
5	12		It goes like… This. 
5	12	Ok. How'd you know I put it in wrong. 	
5	12		Because it, it was upside down. 
5	12	Ok. It was upside down. Ok good. 	
5	12	Whatcha going to do with that piece? Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
5	12		I think it needs to go there. 
5	12	You think it needs to go there? Like that? 	
5	12		That move was silly. 
5	12	Hmm. Where can we put it? 	
5	12		I think it goes here. 
5	12	You think right there? Why'd you wanna try it there?  	
5	12		No. 
5	12		###
5	12	Oh. Let's try to guess without looking. Where do you think it goes 	
5	12	You think right there? Does that match? 	
5	12		No. 
5	12	No? Ok.  	
5	12	Where else could we try it? 	
5	12	There we go. How did you know to put it there?	
5	12		Because it goes right here. 
5	12	How did you know it went right there? 	
5	12		Because on there it said it goes right there
5	12	Ok. And how about this piece? What should I do with this one? Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	Right here? Like this? 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	How'd you know those pieces would match?	
5	12		Because see, it's part of the pig and part of the horse. 
5	12	Ok. And how about this piece?  What should we do with this one? 	
5	12		I think this goes on part of the cow. 
5	12	Ok. So I should put it here? Like that? 	
5	12		No. 
5	12	Ok. Like that? 	
5	12		I think it should go like… right
5	12	Hmm	
5	12		There.
5	12	Like that? Ok. 	
5	12	And what should we do with this piece? 	
5	12		Sheep. 
5	12	Sheep	
5	12		Go right…###
5	12	What made you try it there? 	
5	12	Hmm?	
5	12	There we go. How did you know it went here and not there? 	
5	12		Because it goes here. 
5	12	Ok. 	
5	12	And what should we do with this piece? Can you tell me what to do with it? Hmm?

5	12	Why do you think those two pieces go together? 	
5	12		Because. 
5	12	What else can we try? 	
5	12	How did you know to try that piece there?	
5	12	Huh?	
5	12	Where do you think we should put that one? 	
5	12		I think it goes under the cow/ 
5	12	You think it goes under the cow? 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	Yeah? Ok.  	
5	12		I think we have to do this one last. 
5	12	We have to do that one last? We should wait on it? Ok. 	
5	12	How about this next piece? What should we do with this one? You tell me what to do with it? 	
5	12		Yeah. 
5	12	Yeah?

6	12	How'd you know I put it in wrong? 	
6	12		Because that goes here and that goes here. 
6	12	Ok. And how about this piece? What should we do with this one?	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right here? Like this?	
6	12	How should we fix it? 	
6	12		This way. 
6	12	This way?	
6	12		No. This part goes up here and this part down here. 
6	12	Oh ok. Ok, there we go. 	
6	12	And what about this piece? Where should we put this one? 	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right there? Like that? 	
6	12		This way. 
6	12	This way, like this? 	
6	12		Yeah. 
6	12	Ok. How'd you know it had to go that way? 	
6	12		Because the corner goes right here. 
6	12	Because the corner goes right there.	
6	12	And what about this piece? Where should we out it? 	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right here like this? Is that right? 	
6	12		This way. 
6	12	This way? 	
6	12	How'd you know we had to change it?	
6	12		Because the horse is here and the pig is here. 
6	12	Ok. How about this piece? Where should this one go?  	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right here? Like that? 	
6	12		That corner goes here ###
6	12	The corner goes there? 	
6	12	And what about this piece? Where should we put this one? 	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right here, like this? 	
6	12	How'd you know it had to go there? 	
6	12		Because that was the only corner left. 
6	12	That was the only corner left. Ok. And how can you tell it's a corner? 	
6	12		Yeah. 
6	12	Ok. And what about this piece? Where should we put this one?  	
6	12		Right here. 
6	12	Right here like this? 	
6	12	How do we change it? 	
6	12		This way. 
6	12	This way? How'd you know to put it like this	
6	12		Because that's part of the cow's mouth. Yeah, that's part of the cow's mouth
6	12	Ok. And how about this piece? Where should it go? 	
6	12		Down here. Right here. 
6	12	Right here? 	
6	12		You should… yeah. Put part of the pig up here. 
6	12	Part of the pig up here? 	
6	12		Yeah. 
6	12	Ok. And how about this piece? Where does it go? 	
6	12		Umm. Right here. 
6	12	Right here? 	
6	12	How did you know those pieces would match? 	
6	12		Because that's part of the sheep and that's part of the sheep. 
6	12	And how about this piece? 	
6	12		Yeah. 
6	12	Right there. There we go. Good job. We did the whole thing. 	
7	12	So this one we're going to do a little differently, ok? 	
7	12	So, I'm going to scoot over here for this one. 	
7	12	So for this puzzle we're foinf to play a little game with it. So, I have the puzzle pieces stacked. What we're going to do is you're going to tell me where to put the pieces, and I'm going to put them in ok? 	
7	12	Make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok? 	
7	12	And this is what the puzzle is going to look like when we're all done. 	
7	12	Ready to start? 	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	Ok. So, this is our first piece. Can you tell me what I should do with it? 	
7	12		Mmm. There.
7	12	Right here, like that? 	
7	12	How'd you know it'd fit there? 	
7	12	You don't know? 	
7	12	Ok. What should I do with this piece? 	
7	12	Put it here like this? 	
7	12	How'd you know those two pieces would match?	
7	12		Because this has has half of it. 
7	12	Ok. It's got part of the barn. 	
7	12	Ok. And what about this piece? Can you tell me what to do with this one? 	
7	12	Right here, like this? 	
7	12	No? How should we fix it? 	
7	12	What'd you have to do to make it fit?	
7	12		### right here
7	12	Ok. And what about this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with this one ?	
7	12		Mmm
7	12	Put it here like this? 	
7	12	How'd you know that would go there? 	
7	12		Because it was the rest. I don't know.
7	12	You don't know? Ok. 	
7	12	What should I do with this piece? 	
7	12		Ummm.
7	12	Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12	How can you tell that doesn't work? 	
7	12		Because there's ### any###
7	12	Ok. So what should we do with it? What do you think? 	
7	12	Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
7	12	Right here, like that? 	
7	12	So those two pieces look good then? 	
7	12	Ok. And what should I do with this piece? 	
7	12		Put it…
7	12	Here like this? Does that work? 	
7	12		huh uh
7	12	No? Can you tell me where, what we should do to fix it? 	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	What do you think? 	
7	12	Here like this?	
7	12	What should we do? 	
7	12	Like that? Do those match? 	
7	12		Huh uh. 
7	12	How can you tell those don't match? 	
7	12		Because that is a cat and this is a cow. 
7	12	Ah, ok. 	
7	12	Ok. 	
7	12	What about if we do this? 	
7	12	So how'd you know that had to go there then? 	
7	12		Because this had a corner and that had to go up there. 
7	12	Ok. How can you tell it has a corner?	
7	12		Cause… I don't know. 
7	12	Ok. So where should we put this piece? Can you tell me where we put this one?  	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	Right here, like that? 	
7	12	How'd you know it couldn't go there? 	
7	12		Because it didn't have a.. That. 
7	12	Ok. 	
7	12	Where else can we try that piece? 	
7	12		I don't know. 
7	12	You don't know? 	
7	12	Should we save it for later? 	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	Ok. Where should we put this piece? 	
7	12	Can you tell me what to do with it? 	
7	12	Right here, like this? Will that work?	
7	12	How'd you know to try it there? 	
7	12		Because there was part of the sand. And the pig
7	12	And the pig too?	
7	12	What should we do with this piece? 	
7	12	How did you know it would fit there? 	
7	12		Because it's part of this. 
7	12	Part of that chicken? 	
7	12		Mmhmm
7	12	Ok. What about this piece? Where should we put this one? 	
7	12	Like this? 	
7	12	What'd you do to fix it? 	
7	12		Turn it around 
7	12	Turn it around? Ok. 	
7	12	And how about this piece? Where should we put this one?  	
7	12	Here like that? 	
7	12	How did you know those two pieces would match? 	
7	12		Cause there's part of that. 
7	12	Oh, ok. 	
7	12	And how about this last piece? Where should we put this? 	
7	12	Good job. All done. 	
8	12	Are you ready to do our next puzzle? 	
8	12		huh uh
8	12	Well let's see this one is more of a game with a puzzle, ok? So we'll see if you like it. 	
8	12	Ok. So I'm going to scoot over for this one. 	
8	12	Ok. So for this puzzle what I've done is I've stacked the pieces, ok? 	
8	12		What is this puzzle? 
8	12	Well you see, it's this, it's the same one. I just have the puzzle pieces stacked. Ok? 	
8	12	And what we're going to do is you're going to tell me what to do with the pieces and I'm going to put them in. Ok? 	
8	12	So, make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do. Ok?	
8	12	And this is what the puzzle is going to look like when we’re all done. Ok?	
8	12		Ok. 
8	12	So we'll put this down. 	
8	12	Ok, so this is our first piece. Can you tell me what I should do with it? Where do you think it should go?  	
8	12	Here like this?  	
8	12	Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12	What about this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with this one? 	
8	12	Here like this? Does that look good? 	
8	12	How should I fix it? 	
8	12	Does that look like it matches? 	
8	12	No? Ok. 	
8	12	Let's see. What if we put it like this? 	
8	12	Does that look good? 	
8	12	Yeah. So should we keep these two pieces here? 	
8	12		Yeah
8	12	Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece? 	
8	12	Right here, like that? Does that look right? 	
8	12	Why doesn't it look right? 	
8	12	Can you use your words and tell me why it doesn't look right? What'd you just do with your fingers? 	
8	12		I don't know how to do this. 
8	12	That's ok. What did you just do with your fingers? When you pointed here and here. 	
8	12		That goes there in
8	12	So this has to go here? 	
8	12		Yeah. 
8	12	Ok. Like that? Does that look right? 	
8	12	What if we do this? 	
8	12	That looks like it matches right?	
8	12	Yeah. Ok. 	
8	12	So what if we… Do you think these pieces look right here? 	
8	12		I don't know how to do this yet. 
8	12	That's ok I have the puzzle pieces stacked. So, that one will probably come later.	
8	12	So what if we do this? 	
8	12		It… Yeah. 
8	12	Does that look better? Can you tell me why it looks better? Why do you think? 	
8	12	Why do you think it looks better there instead of there? 	
8	12		I don't know. 
8	12	You don't know? Ok. 	
8	12	What should I do with this piece? 	
8	12	Uh. Like this? 	
8	12		Mmhm
8	12	Does that look right? 	
8	12	Yeah. How'd you know it'd go there instead? 	
8	12	Huh? How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12		I don't know. 
8	12	You don't know? Ok. 	
8	12	Can you find where this piece goes? Where do you think it should go? 	
8	12	Here like this? Does that look like it matches? 	
8	12	No. Ok. Where else do you think we can try that piece? 	
8	12	What if we try that piece here? 	
8	12	Humm. Not sure it matches like that. 	
8	12	What about if we try it here? Does that look good? 	
8	12	Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12	Can you tell me what I should do with this one? 	
8	12	How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12		I don't know. 
8	12	What? How'd you get that? You got that on your first try. 	
8	12		I said mmmm. 
8	12	Mmmm. Ok. Is that your thinking noise? 	
8	12	Ok. Wha	
8	12		What's in there? 
8	12	Toys. 	
8	12		Can I see? 
8	12	You can pick one out when we're all done. 	
8	12		Ok. 
8	12		### Ow. 
8	12	How'd you know it wouldn't fit there? '	
8	12		Because it's too big. 
8	12	Ah. It's too big. 	
8	12		Know what I have at home? 
8	12	What? 	
8	12		A box and all my toys are in there. 
8	12	Yeah? Does it look like that? 	
8	12	That's pretty cool. 	
8	12		Yeah, but it's not a treasure chest. 
8	12	Ah. It's a toy chest? 	
8	12		Yeah. 
8	12	Yeah. Ok. 	
8	12		No it's not. It's… It's for big people like you.
8	12	Yeah? Ok. 	
8	12	You know what? I think that piece might go here. 	
8	12		Yeah it does. 
8	12	There you go. Good job. 	
8	12	How'd you know it wouldn't go the way you had it before? How'd you know it didn't go like that? 	
8	12		Because it's supposed to go that way. Then it's supposed to connect. 
8	12	Ok. Can you tell me where this piece goes? 	
8	12		I don't 
8	12	How do you know it won't go there? How'd you figure that out? 	
8	12	You don't know? Ok. Well where should we put this piece. 	
8	12	Right here like this? Does that look right?	
8	12	Let's see what if we try that one here? 	
8	12	Can you try that piece here? I think it may fit there. 	
8	12	There we go. 	
8	12		It still hurt. 
8	12	Oh, what'd you do to your finger? 	
8	12		Umm I hurt it. 
8	12	How'd you hurt it? 	
8	12		Umm. Because something was stuck in there and had to get it out. 
8	12	Ok. It's a cool band-aid though. 	
8	12		It's a little hole
8	12	You got a cool band-aid to cover it up though. 	
8	12		I can't do it. 
8	12	It's ok. Let's try it somewhere else. 	
8	12	Humm. What about if you try that piece here? 	
8	12	Can you just put it a different way there?	
8	12	Oop. I think that piece stays there. 	
8	12	What about if we put this piece this way? 	
8	12	Can you put it here? 	
8	12	I don't think those quite match. Let's try it like that. 	
8	12	That looks good right? 	
8	12		No. 
8	12	No? Well here what about this piece? Where do you think this one goes. 	
8	12		I wanna pick out the turtle 
8	12	I don't know if we have any turtles. 	
8	12	I think this one goes here. 	
8	12	What should we do with this one? 	
8	12	How could you tell it would fit there? 	
8	12		I don’t know. 
8	12	How'd you figure that out on your first try? 	
8	12		There's a little more
8	12	Yeah, there are two pieces left. 	
8	12		I ah
8	12		Does it go by a Bah
8	12	A sheep? 	
8	12		Like that
8	12	How'd you know it had to go that way? 	
8	12		Cause. 
8	12	Cause how? 	
8	12		This. 
8	12	Ok. Good job! You finished two whole puzzles. Now we're going to do a couple more with your mom. Ok? 	
9	12	So this one we're gonna do a little differently ok?	
9	12	For this one we're gonna play a game with it.	
9	12	Ok let me move over here.	
9	12	So for this one I have the puzzle pieces stacked, ok?	
9	12	And what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in, ok?	
9	12	Yeah. But make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do ok?	
9	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
9	12		## have two of them?
9	12	What?	
9	12	I just have this one so you can see what it'll look like.	
9	12	It's the same puzzle. Ok?	
9	12	You ready to start?	
9	12		I have that one.
9	12	You have this one too?	
9	12		Mm-hm.
9	12	Ok. So here's our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
9	12		Um, I think it's a corner piece.
9	12	Ok, so where should it go?	
9	12		I think right here.
9	12	Oh ok. And how'd you know it was a corner piece?	
9	12	Ok.	
9	12	And what should I do with this piece?	
9	12		Um.
9	12	Can you tell me what I should do with it?	
9	12		I think it's a corner piece too.
9	12	You think that's a corner piece too? So I should put it here?	
9	12		no.
9	12	No? why not? How can you tell that's wrong?	
9	12		Because it's a little bit short up here.
9	12	Oh ok so how should we fix it?	
9	12		I think… hm, maybe it's not a corner piece.
9	12	No? Can you see where it should go?	
9	12		Maybe right here… no.
9	12	No?	
9	12		I think it should try to go here… no.
9	12	How can you tell it doesn't go there?	
9	12		Because because the leg.
9	12	Ok. It doesn't fit?	
9	12	So can you see where else we should try this?	
9	12	Here like that?	
9	12		No.
9	12		Don't know yet.
9	12	You don't know yet? Ok.	
9	12	Well what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
9	12		Maybe right here?
9	12	Yeah, I bet.	
9	12	No? How can you tell that's wrong?	
9	12		Because…
9	12	Oh, cause of that part? Ok.	
9	12		And that part.
9	12	So how should we fix it do you think.	
9	12	That match?	
9	12	No?	
9	12	Let's see… what about if we did this.	
9	12		### oh.
9	12	Now can you tell where we should put these?	
9	12		I don't know.
9	12	What do you think.	
9	12	Where else could it go.	
9	12		###.
9	12	Well should we leave these here for now.	
9	12	That look good? Hm?	
9	12	What could we do with these pieces?	
9	12	Leave them there? Ok.	
9	12	And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
9	12		I have the cat at home.
9	12	You do?	
9	12		I mean I have two.
9	12	Oh ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
9	12	What do you think. Where do you think it should go.	
9	12		Right there.
9	12	Right there? How could you tell those two pieces would go together?	
9	12	How'd you figure that out?	
9	12		Because if you take them off, because they have the same…
9	12	Have the same what?	
9	12		They have the same thingy here.
9	12	Oh same thing there? Ok.	
9	12	So can you figure out what we should do with these three pieces yet?	
9	12	Where should they go?	
9	12	There still?	
9	12	What about this piece, can you tell me where I should put this one.	
9	12	Well what if we put these like this.	
9	12		Yeah.
9	12	That look good?	
9	12		Yeah.
9	12	Ok so where should we put this piece.	
9	12		Fitting the fit, fit…
9	12	Won't fit there?	
9	12	No?	
9	12		Yes.
9	12	But does it match? That look like it matches?	
9	12		No.
9	12	No? so where else could we put it?	
9	12		Here… ###...
9	12	There? Does that look good there?	
9	12	No?	
9	12		Um… I don't know.
9	12	You don't know? Should we save that one for later?	
9	12		Yeah.
9	12	Ok. Tell me what we should do with this piece?	
9	12		I don't know.
9	12	You don't know? Do you have a guess?	
9	12	Let's make a guess where do you think it could go.	
9	12		I want a break.
9	12	You want a break? Well what if we put this one here.	
9	12	Then can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
9	12		No.
9	12	No? What if it goes there?	
9	12	Ok we're almost done.	
9	12	Can you tell me where this piece would go?	
9	12		I want a break.
9	12	You want a break? Ok what if we finish this one really fast and then you go play with your dad?	
9	12	Does that sound good?	
9	12	Ok I think that one goes there.	
9	12	And that one goes there.	
9	12	Can you see what we should do with this one?	
9	12	Maybe that one try it?	
9	12	Go there?	
9	12	Hm, what about if it goes here.	
9	12	There we go and the last one you wanna put that one in?	
9	12	Good job how'd you know it had to go like that?	
9	12		There's only one more.
9	12	Yeah, ok.	
10	12	Ok well this one we're gonna do a game with it ok?	
10	12	So it's gonna be oops a little different.	
10	12	Ok so I'm gonna scoot over for this one.	
10	12		Oh I have that one.
10	12	You do?	
10	12		Yeah I have it's a new one of them.
10	12	It's a new one?	
10	12		Yeah.
10	12	Ok.	
10	12		It's a new one.
10	12	Ok so for this puzzle I have the puzzle pieces all stacked, ok?	
10	12	and what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok?	
10	12		Ok.
10	12	But you gotta make sure to use your words because I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do ok?	
10	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
10	12	Ok? Ready to start?

11	12	ok. And now can you figure out where that one goes.	
11	12	good job.	
12	12	Ok so for this puzzle I've stacked all the puzzle pieces ok?	
12	12	so what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok?	
12	12	Ok but make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do ok?

12	12	ok. So here's our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
12	12		put it right there.
12	12	put it right here like this?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok. How'd you know it'd go there?	
12	12		because there's a horse right next to it.
12	12	ok. And what about this piece what should I do with that one can you use your words and tell me?	
12	12		you should put it right there.
12	12	I should put it right here like this?	
12	12		no.
12	12	No? how could you tell that's wrong?	
12	12		cause oh.
12	12		should turn it around like this.
12	12	should turn it around like that?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok how'd you know we had to fix it?	
12	12		because there was a pig right there and there was a pig right there.
12	12	oh ok. And what about this piece can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
12	12		you should put that right there.
12	12	put it right here like that?	
12	12		no.
12	12	no?	
12	12		you have to turn it around.
12	12	turn it around like this?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	gotcha. How'd you know we had to fix it?	
12	12		because there wasn't a connecting here.
12	12	oh ok. And what about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
12	12		you should put it right here.
12	12	right here like this?	
12	12		no, turn it around.
12	12	turn it around?	
12	12		like this.
12	12	ok. How could you tell I put it in wrong.	
12	12		because the tail supposed to be right here on the barn.
12	12	ok and how about this piece what should we do with this one.	
12	12		I, uh, not ready for that piece yet.
12	12	we're not? Are you sure?	
12	12		I'm sure.
12	12	do you have a guess where it could go?	
12	12		I could guess it go right there but that has but that has a pig on it.
12	12	ok. So do you have another guess where it should go?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	yeah, where. Where else do you think it could go.	
12	12		I think it could go right here.
12	12	go right here? Should we try it there then?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok. Why do you think it could go there?	
12	12		because it's a corner.
12	12	because it's a corner, ok.	
12	12	and how about this piece could you tell me what I should do with this one?	
12	12		you should put it right here.
12	12	put it right here like this?	
12	12		no, turn it around. The face go right there.
12	12	oh ok the horse's face?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok and how did you know we needed to put this piece there.	
12	12		because it has the other connecting, two connectings.
12	12	oh ok two connectings?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok and what should we do with this piece.	
12	12		you should put it right there.
12	12	put it here like this?	
12	12		no. where the pig is.
12	12	the pig is?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	that match right there?	
12	12		no.
12	12	no? so how should we fix it do you think.	
12	12		I think we have to wait for where we when we are getting to the cow.
12	12	oh ok do you have a guess where it could go though, should we make a guess where  you think it could go?	
12	12		I don't know.
12	12	you don't know? We should save it?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok. How about this piece, where should this one go.	
12	12		we should save that one too.
12	12	save this one too?	
12	12	are you sure, you don't have a guess where this one could go?	
12	12		no.
12	12	no?	
12	12		but I only see part of a pig
12	12		and another part of a oh I think it could go right there.
12	12	think it could go here like this?	
12	12	that look like it matches?	
12	12		no.
12	12	no? ok.	
12	12	so you don't see anything on the puzzle that could match this yet?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok that's why we should save it?	
12	12	ok how about this piece, where should this one go.	
12	12		right there.
12	12	right here like this?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok how'd you know it had to go there?	
12	12		because it has a pig face and that's part of a pig.
12	12	oh ok got it.	
12	12	and how about this piece what should we do with this one.	
12	12		put it right there.
12	12	put it right here like this?	
12	12		uh, turn it around.
12	12	turn it around?	
12	12		like that.
12	12	like that. How'd you know it had to go in that way.	
12	12		because there's a rooster this way and a cow this way.
12	12	ok got it. So how about this piece do we have a guess where that one could go now?	
12	12		yeah right here.
12	12	right there?	
12	12		you have to turn it around.
12	12	turn it around?	
12	12		yeah like that.
12	12	ok how'd you know it needed to go that way.	
12	12		because that because that's the connecting.
12	12	the connecting? Ok.	
12	12	and this piece, we still don't know where that one could go?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok.	
12	12	how about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
12	12		put it right there.
12	12	put it right here like this?	
12	12		uh, turn it around.
12	12	turn it around?	
12	12	and put it like this?	
12	12		yeah.
12	12	ok how'd you know those pieces would match?	
12	12		because. Because, because that's right
12	12	because that's what?	
12	12		because that's right
12	12	ok	
12	12		and that's, now I know where
12	12	now you know where this one goes? Where does this one go?	
12	12		go right there.
12	12	go right there? How'd you figure that one out?	
12	12		because that right there that one's right there this face right
12	12	oh ok and how about that piece, our last piece?	
12	12		right there.
12	12	right there? How'd you figure that one out?	
12	12		because I saw the two pegs.
12	12	oh ok. Good job.	
13	12	Ok so what we're gonna do with this puzzle is we're gonna play a game with it ok?	
13	12	So I have the puzzle pieces stacked	
13	12	and what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok?	
13	12		In the right order?
13	12	Yeah but make sure to use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do ok?

13	12	Oh ok. And how about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12		Uh, put it right… here.
13	12	Put it right here? Does that work right there?	
13	12		No.
13	12	No? How can you tell it doesn't work?	
13	12		I think it fits right here.
13	12	So how did you know you needed to put it there instead of right here.	
13	12		That's because it has, that's because there's a cow.
13	12	Because it has a cow? And so why shouldn't the cow go there?	
13	12		That's because it has a point pointing like this.
13	12	Oh it has a point like that? Ok.	
13	12	Can you tell me what I should do with this one?	
13	12		Put it right here.
13	12	Put it right here like this?	
13	12		You fix it… like this.
13	12	Oh, how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
13	12		That's because you put it in upside down?
13	12	I put it in upside down? How could you tell it was upside down?	
13	12		Like this.
13	12	Ok. So how could you tell I put it in upside down.	
13	12		That's because this doesn't have this.
13	12	Oh ok.	
13	12		And I turn it around like this, it does make it fit there.
13	12	Oh ok good job.	
13	12	Ok and what should we do with that one.	
13	12		Put it right here.
13	12	Right there? Ok and why did you try it there what made you try it there?	
13	12		The chicken.
13	12	The chicken? Ok.	
13	12	And what should we do with this piece, can I take a turn can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12		Put it right here.
13	12	Put it right there? Ok how'd you know it'd match those other two pieces?	
13	12		That's because the cow carried the chicken.
13	12		That's funny.
13	12	It is funny isn't it.	
13	12	Ok can I take a turn on this piece? Can you tell me what I should do with it?	
13	12		Put it right here.
13	12	Put it right here like this?	
13	12		No like this.
13	12	ok. How'd you fix it?	
13	12		That's because you turn it upside down like… like this.
13	12	Ok and how could you tell that was upside down?	
13	12		Because you know turn it around upside down.
13	12	Ok.	
13	12		And I turn it around upside up.
13	12	Ok, upside up.	
13	12		Hey this piece it looks like me.
13	12	Yeah? So what should we do with that piece.	
13	12		Put it here.
13	12	Put it there?	
13	12		Yeah, and it looks like me.
13	12	Looks like you?	
13	12	Can you put it in?	
13	12		Yeah.
13	12	Ok. And how'd you know we needed to put it that way?	
13	12		That's because it has a cow face.
13	12	It has a cow face?	
13	12		It has a cow over here like this ###
13	12	Yeah ok good job.

17	12	Right here like this?	
17	12		We push it in, ooh.
17	12	Uh, does it fit?	
17	12		Yeah, let's try this later.
17	12	Let's try it later. Ok. What should I do with this piece?	
17	12		I think it goes right up here.
17	12	Up here like this?	
17	12		No.
17	12	No? Not like that?	
17	12	What should I do with this piece?	
17	12		Put it…
17	12	Uh huh?	
17	12	Put it here like this?	
17	12	Uh, doesn't fit. What should I do with this piece.	
17	12		I think you turn it around didn't go into
17	12	Turn it around this much?	
17	12		No.
17	12	This much?	
17	12		No.
17	12	or, this much?	
17	12		No.
17	12	Or, what should I do.	
17	12		You turn it around like this way.
17	12	This much? Ok.	
17	12	Then put it here?	
17	12		Let's see.
17	12	Uh, doesn't fit.	
17	12		No.
17	12		Let's try another one.
17	12	Ok, let's try this one.	
17	12	What should I do with this piece?	
17	12	Ok, should I put it like this?	
17	12		No.
17	12	No? Should I turn it this,	
17	12		Right here.
17	12	Like this? Ok.	
17	12		Fits.
17	12	Alright, what should I do with this piece.	
17	12	Over here? Like this?	
17	12		no.
17	12	No, what should I do?	
17	12		Turn it around like this.
17	12	Turn it around like this? Ok.	
17	12	Ok, now do you wanna try this one?	
17	12	Or do you wanna try this one?	
17	12		That first.
17	12	That one first? Ok.	
17	12		Put it right here.
17	12	Here, like this?	
17	12		No.
17	12	No? What should I do?	
17	12		Turn it around.
17	12	Turn it like this? Ok.	
17	12	Ok. Do you want to try this one?	
17	12	Yeah? Ok what should I do with this.	
17	12		Turn it around.
17	12	Turn it around? Like this? Ok.	
17	12	Do you want to try this one?	
17	12		It goes…
17	12	What should I do with it.	
17	12		Right here.
17	12	Like this?	
17	12		No.
17	12	Turn it again? Ok.	
17	12	Ok.	
17	12	What should I do with this piece, the final one?	
17	12	Ok, like this?	
17	12		No.
17	12	No? What should I do then?	
17	12		You put it like
17	12	Tell me	
17	12		Right here
17	12	Do you know which side to turn?	
17	12	Which direction to turn?	
17	12	Ok, like this?	
17	12	Ok, you're all done.	
18	12	So see how I've got all these puzzle pieces stacked together?	
18	12	Kay we're just gonna look at this one ok?	
18	12	So we're gonna play with this one instead of this one.	
18	12	Hey ### she's gonna show you how to play a game with this puzzle, ok?	
18	12	So this one's just to look at, ok?	
18	12	See look, she's already got all those pieces taken out, and this one's gonna look the exact same when it's all done ok?	
18	12	So I'm gonna take this one over here and you're gonna listen to what ###'s gonna say.	
18	12	That okay?	
18	12	Ok so you're gonna tell me where each piece goes, ok?	
18	12	and then I'm gonna put them in and then, uh, you have to tell me how to put them in so that they fit right	
18	12	and so make sure to use all of your words and tell me exactly where they should go	
18	12	That okay?	
18	12	so what should I do with this piece?	
18	12	ok. So why do you think it goes there?	
18	12	okay, how did you know that these two pieces fit together like that?	
18	12	do you know where this one should go?	
18	12	ok, why did it go like that?	
18	12	do you know how it fits?	
18	12	ok, do you know where this one should go?	
18	12	like that? Is that right?	
18	12	no? ok.	
18	12	oh, so like that.	
18	12	so why did it fit like that, do you know?	
18	12	you wanna tell me how it works?	
18	12	uh, ok. So let's try this one.	
18	12	so should I put it in like that?	
18	12	no? ok. So how should I put it.	
18	12	like that? Is that how you want it?	
18	12	ok. So then, where should this piece go.	
18	12	oh, so like that.	
18	12	ok. Do you know how, why it went like that?	
18	12	you wanna try and use your words?	
18	12	ok. So let's try this piece. Do you know where it goes?	
18	12	where should it go?	
18	12	here? Like that?	
18	12	no?	
18	12	do you wanna tell me why you think it goes there?	
18	12	maybe we should put this one over here? And save it for later?	
18	12	do you want to do that?	
18	12	ok. So where do you think this one should go.	
18	12	here? Why's that?	
18	12	is that right?	
18	12	why do you know that, why did you know it fit?	
18	12	just cause?	
18	12	ok. So where should this piece go?	
18	12	here, let me try.	
18	12	does that work.	
18	12	ok, do you know why it fit there?	
18	12	do you want to tell me why it fit there?	
18	12	ok. Um, so you want to try this one?	
18	12	like that? Ok.	
18	12	Does that look right?	
18	12	ok. So where should this one go?	
18	12	over here?	
18	12	should I just put it in like that?	
18	12	maybe it shouldn't go there?	
18	12	or maybe something's wrong with another part of the puzzle?	
18	12	which part of the puzzle is probably not where it should be?	
18	12	maybe if you took this one apart.	
18	12	would you be able to fit it in then?	
18	12	so it's like that.	
18	12	well maybe that doesn't go there since you keep pushing it in and it doesn't fit.	
18	12	do you want to tell me why this piece went there?	
18	12	ok. How should I put this piece.	
18	12	here like that?	
18	12	ok why does it goes like that?	
18	12	do you know?	
18	12	ok. Where should we put this piece.	
18	12	ok, great.	
19	12	So here is our first piece, can you tell me what to do with it?	
19	12		Uh, I think that goes right there.
19	12	Think that goes there?	
19	12	ok. And why do you think it goes there.	
19	12		because it's a corner piece.
19	12		because it's a corner piece and that's the only where we can put it because because these other corners can't fit it.
19	12	ok. And why, how do you know it's a corner piece.	
19	12		because because that corner's right there.
19	12	ok. And what do you think I should do with this piece.	
19	12		we should put that right there.
19	12	right here?	
19	12	ok, and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
19	12		because that hump and that red part I think it was part of the barn.
19	12	oh ok. And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with this one?	
19	12		I think that goes right there.
19	12	you think that goes right here like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no, how should I fix it?	
19	12		you should turn it over a little bit.
19	12	this way?	
19	12		yeah.
19	12	oh ok how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
19	12		because it was, nothing could connect with this.
19	12	oh ok . And what about this piece, can you tell where where we should put this one?	
19	12		we should put it right there.
19	12	right here like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no? ok. How should I fix it.	
19	12		you should turn it over.
19	12	turn it over this way?	
19	12		yeah.
19	12	ok and how'd you know it needed to go that way.	
19	12		because because I thought the cat goes right there.
19	12	oh. And how about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
19	12		hmm… I think that goes right there.
19	12	right here like this?	
19	12	ok and why do you think it goes there.	
19	12		because it's kind of like he's sitting down
19	12	oh ok. And what about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
19	12		hm, I think that goes right there.
19	12	right here like this?	
19	12		yep.
19	12	ok and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
19	12		because the horse's eyes are right there.
19	12	and what about this piece where should I put this one.	
19	12		um, that goes…
19	12		I think it goes
19	12	right here?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no? how could we tell that's wrong?	
19	12		because hmm.
19	12		because that's right there.
19	12	oh ok so what do you think we should do with this piece then.	
19	12	you think here like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no, ok, so what do you think we should do?	
19	12		we should flip it over.
19	12	flip it over like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no, hmm.	
19	12		think that goes… right there.
19	12	right here like this?	
19	12	do you think all the pieces that we have in right now are where they're supposed to be?	
19	12	no? do you think one's wrong?	
19	12	if we can't find where this one goes?	
19	12	which one could be wrong do you think?	
19	12		hey…
19	12	hm? Should we save this one for later do you think?	
19	12		maybe we should, maybe that, that piece doesn't fit anywhere.
19	12	you don't think it fits anywhere?	
19	12		except here.
19	12	except there?	
19	12		yeah because the corner's too big for this.
19	12	ok. Well what about if we do this.	
19	12		hmm, maybe that's
19	12	then where do you think that one goes.	
19	12	yeah ok.	
19	12	and how could you tell it goes there.	
19	12		because if we switched it, the cat was right there and we couldn't put that right here because so we switched these two and then and then this one went right there
19	12	ok. And what about this piece, can you tell me what we should do with that one?	
19	12		I think that one goes right there.
19	12	oh ok that there?	
19	12	why did you think it went there?	
19	12		because the cat's, the rest of the cat was right there.
19	12	oh ok. And how about this piece where do you think this one should go?	
19	12		I think right there.
19	12	think here like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no? how could we tell that's wrong?	
19	12		because because the head is supposed to go on the top
19	12	oh ok. Alright I just need one of you guys to sib sit, cause she's just gonna do the questionnaires and the ## so	
19	12	ok so what should we do to fix it do you think.	
19	12		um I think the corner should go with this corner.
19	12	like this?	
19	12		yeah.
19	12	oh ok. And how'd you know it needed to go that way?	
19	12		because that part of this part that matches
19	12	oh ok. And what about this piece where should this one go.	
19	12		right there.
19	12	ok. Like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no? how should I fix it?	
19	12		flip it over
19	12	over like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12		flip it again, do it again.
19	12	do it again? Ok.	
19	12	and how could you tell I put it in wrong	
19	12		because this, this was a side piece
19	12	oh ok. And how could you tell it's a side piece.	
19	12		because that side was right there.
19	12	oh ok. And what about this piece what should we do with this one.	
19	12		um that should go right there.
19	12	should go right here like this?	
19	12		no.
19	12	no? and how should I fix it?	
19	12		you should flip it around.
19	12	flip it like this?	
19	12		yeah.
19	12	ok and how'd you know I needed to do that?	
19	12		because the sheep's wool is right there.
19	12	ok. And what about our last piece, where should we put that one?	
19	12		right there.
19	12	right here like this?	
19	12		no, flip it over.
19	12	and how'd you know we needed to do that.	
19	12		because because the duckling's, the rest of the duckling's right there.
19	12	oh ok good job we're all done.	
20	12	ok so this is our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
20	12	think it should go here like this?	
20	12	does that look right?	
20	12	that looks good?	
20	12	ok why do you think it goes there?	
20	12		um, I don't know.
20	12	you don't know?	
20	12	ok, you just guessed?	
20	12	ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
20	12		there.
20	12	right here like this?	
20	12	ok, and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
20	12		cause there's a piece of the barn.
20	12	oh cause it was the red piece of the barn? Ok.	
20	12	and how about this piece, where do you think this one goes.	
20	12	like this?	
20	12	ok how'd you know those pieces would match?	
20	12		because and the horse feet in jelly
20	12	oh ok.	
20	12		I mean in jello.
20	12	oh, in jello? Ok.	
20	12	can you tell me where this piece should go?	
20	12	oh, it should go here like this?	
20	12	ok how'd you know it would go there?	
20	12		because there was horse feet.
20	12	horse feet again? Ok.	
20	12	and so these pieces look good here? Ok.	
20	12	so what should we do with this piece.	
20	12	it should go here? That look good?	
20	12	ok and why do you think it goes there?	
20	12		because pig's feet are low.
20	12	cause what?	
20	12		the pig's feet are low to the ground.
20	12	oh, pig's feet are low to the ground ok.	
20	12	so what should we do with this piece do you think.	
20	12	do you think it should go here?	
20	12	ok. So you think these pieces still look good here?	
20	12	or should we fix them a little bit.	
20	12		I think that piece should go there.
20	12	oh ok. And how'd you know that piece would go there?	
20	12		I think the pig is… the pig should go, um, right here.
20	12	Right here, so you think	
20	12	I think these are right though, the way we have them but I think we need to do this.	
20	12	that look better? Ok.	
20	12	so here's our next piece what do you think we should do with it.	
20	12	we should put it here like this?	
20	12	that look right?	
20	12	does this look wrong?	
20	12	I put it in wrong? How should I fix it?	
20	12		turn around.
20	12	turn it around like this? Ok.	
20	12	and how did you know I needed to do that?	
20	12		um…
20	12	hm? How'd you figure that out?	
20	12		I don't know.
20	12	you don't know?	
20	12	well I put it in wrong how'd you figure out that I put it in wrong?	
20	12	how'd you know I needed to turn it around?	
20	12		because…
20	12	what's that?	
20	12		the puzzle, the cow's body.
20	12	oh ok. And what should I do with this next piece.	
20	12	you think it should go here?	
20	12		nah.
20	12	nah, why not? How do we know that's wrong?	
20	12		there's a duck right there.
20	12	oh cause there's a duck right there?	
20	12	ok so what do you think we should do with that piece?	
20	12		I don't know.
20	12	you don't know? Should we save it for later?	
20	12	we can come back on it later?	
20	12	ok. What should we do with this piece.	
20	12	put it right here like this?	
20	12		I think that's wrong.
20	12	you think that's wrong? I think it's wrong too.	
20	12	but why do you think it's wrong though.	
20	12		because it, um, the cow's head's supposed to be up here.
20	12	oh the cow's head's supposed to be up here.	
20	12	ok how do you know the cow's head is supposed to be up there?	
20	12		because they're not ants.
20	12	oh ok cause cows aren't ants.	
20	12	ok how about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
20	12	right here like this?	
20	12		I think that's wrong.
20	12	you think that's wrong so how should I fix it and make it right.	
20	12	what's what should I do there.	
20	12		turn it around.
20	12	turn it around like this? Ok.	
20	12	and how'd you know I needed to do that?	
20	12		because I don't know.
20	12	you don't know?	
20	12	how'd you figure that out?	
20	12	you must have known something.	
20	12	that's ok. What should we do with this piece	
20	12	put it here like this?	
20	12		mhmm.
20	12	ok and how'd you know it needed to go there?	
20	12		because there was a duck head there.
20	12	oh ok.and how about this piece what should we do with this one.	
20	12	put it here like this?	
20	12	does that look right?	
20	12		no.
20	12	no, so how should we fix it.	
20	12	what	
20	12		turn it around.
20	12	oh turn it around.	
20	12	like this?	
20	12	and how'd you know we needed to do that.	
20	12		because there's a cow head there.
20	12	oh ok. And how about our last piece, do we know where this one should go now?	
20	12	right here, ok, and how'd you know it needed to go there?	
20	12		because there was one more space.
20	12	oh ok good job.	
21	12	Now I'm going to teach you how to play a game with the puzzle, ok?	
21	12	Ok. So, the way we're going to play this game.	
21	12	First I'm gonna scoot over here.	
21	12	So for this game I've all the puzzle pieces stacked, ok?	
21	12	And what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in.	
21	12	But make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do, ok?	
21	12	And this is what the puzzle's going to look like when we're all done.	
21	12	Ok? You ready to start?	
21	12	I have all these pieces, it's the same puzzle ok?	
21	12	So we're going to put this down here so we can't see the puzzle.	
21	12	Ok, so this is our first piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
21	12		You put it on the cow.
21	12	Put it on the cow, so where should it go?	
21	12	Where should it go on that puzzle.	
21	12	Here? Like that?	
21	12		Mm-hm.
21	12	Ok, why do you think it goes there?	
21	12		Because the barn is here.
21	12	Because the barn's there? Ok.	
21	12	And what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
21	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do?	
21	12		This.
21	12	Put it there, like that?	
21	12	That look like it matches?	
21	12		This.
21	12	Oh, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
21	12		Oh, box.
21	12	Yeah, okkay, so should we leave these pieces here or what should we do with them?	
21	12	Here like that?	
21	12		Mm-hm.
21	12	Ok, why do you think they go there?	
21	12		Because, because the pig! There's not enough space!
21	12	Oh, so what should we do with it?	
21	12	Do you think it goes there, or do we have to fix it?	
21	12		We have to fix it right here.
21	12	Ok, so it should go here like this?	
21	12		Mm-hm.
21	12	Ok. And what should we do with this piece?	
21	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do?	
21	12	I'm gonna take a turn.	
21	12		I'm, I'm, you, you put right here.
21	12	Put it right here like this? Oh.	
21	12		See?
21	12	Yeah, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
21	12		Yeah, I don't know.
21	12	You don't know? How'd you figure it out?	
21	12		By doing this. 
21	12	By doing what?	
21	12		By matching it.
21	12	By matching it? Ok.	
21	12	And what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
21	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
21	12		Mm-hm, you should put it right here.
21	12	Put it right here like this?	
21	12	Ok, and how'd you know it had to go there?	
21	12		Cause it doesn't match up with the head.
21	12	Oh, and how could you tell it wouldn't match with the head?	
21	12		Cause here, if I put the tail in the front it wouldn't match.
21	12	Oh, if you put the tail in the front it wouldn't match?	
21	12		See?
21	12	Oh, ok.	
21	12	How could you tell it doesn't match there?	
21	12		Cause, um.
21	12	That's, there. So how could we tell that it doesn't match.	
21	12		See?
21	12	Ok. Ok, so what should we do with this piece?	
21	12		Hmm, maybe not.
21	12	Maybe not? Why don't you think it goes there?	
21	12		See?
21	12	Oh, how can we tell it doesn't match there?	
21	12	What about it makes us tell that it can't go there?	
21	12		What's this can go there.
21	12	I don't know. Where do you think this piece goes?	
21	12	Do you have a guess?	
21	12	Think it goes there?	
21	12		No.
21	12	No? Oh. 	
21	12		See?
21	12	Yeah? Ok. So where should we put it?	
21	12		So, we should put it…
21	12		It's there so the pig.
21	12	Hmm?	
21	12		See?
21	12	It's a pig?	
21	12		Mm-hm, see?
21	12	Okay, so where should the pig go, do you think?	
21	12	Well, what about if we do this?	
21	12	Does that look right?	
21	12		Mm-hm.
21	12	Ok. How could we tell that it looks right?	
21	12	Now do you have a guess for where this piece would go?	
21	12		No!
21	12	How could you tell it doesn't go there?	
21	12		See?
21	12	Oh, ok. And how can we tell it doesn't fit?	
21	12	What makes you think it doesn't fit?	
21	12	What do you see?	
21	12		I see this right here.
21	12	Oh, ok, and what is that.	
21	12		That's the rest of this.
21	12	Oh ok, so where do you think that piece should go?	
21	12	It doesn't go there. Where else could it go?	
21	12	Should we save it for later?	
21	12		Mm-hm.
21	12	ok, we can come back to that one.	
21	12	What about this piece, where should this one go?	
21	12	Can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
21	12		That, right here.
21	12	It goes here?	
21	12	That look right?	
21	12		No.
21	12	No? So how should we fix it do you think?	
21	12		Like this.
21	12	Oh ok, how'd you fix it?	
21	12	How'd you fix it, what'd you do to fix it?	
21	12		I don't know, I don't know!
21	12	No? Ok. What about this piece, where should that one go?	
21	12		On the bottom.
21	12	On the bottom? Why do you think it goes on the bottom?	
21	12		Cause, cause cause hey! Where's there's the feet!
21	12	Oh, I don't know.	
21	12	So where should this piece go?	
21	12		Right here.
21	12	Right there?	
21	12	Ok. Does that fit there?	
21	12		Hmm. Think we should, see it later, just put off the puzzle for later.
21	12	Oh, ok, we should leave that piece for later?	
21	12		No, all, no, every- the puzzle!
21	12	Well, let's try to finish it.	
21	12		The puzzle, puzzle!
21	12	Can we try to finish it?	
21	12		Puzzle! Puzzle! Puzzle for later!
21	12	Can we try to finish it quickly?	
21	12		No no no no no no…
21	12	Here, where do you think this piece should go?	
21	12		Hey, ###! 
21	12	What?	
21	12		No, I don't wanna do a puzzle.
21	12	You don't wanna do it?	
21	12	Here what if I put this piece here.	
21	12	That look like it matches?	
21	12		I don't wanna do it.
21	12	You don't wanna do it? Are you sure?	
21	12		Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.
21	12	Okay, should we do the puzzles with your mom now?	
22	12	Okay we're going to play a game with this puzzle, okay?	
22	12		What is it?
22	12	Okay so what I've done is I've stacked the pieces okay?	
22	12		That's another farm puzzle but it's already put together.
22	12	You're right it is.	
22	12	So this is what it's going to look like when we're all done, okay?	
22	12	Okay, so what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces but I'm going to put them in, okay?	
22	12	But make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, okay?	
22	12		Maybe that piece goes here.
22	12	You think so?	
22	12	You think it goes there?	
22	12		Try a different way.
22	12	Try a different way?	
22	12	That way?	
22	12	Okay why do you think it goes there?	
22	12		Because the edges work there.
22	12	Oh, okay, and where are the edges?	
22	12		Right here.
22	12	Ok. Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
22	12		You should put it right here see if it fits there.
22	12		It fits!
22	12	There you go, how can you tell it fits?	
22	12		That part's the horsey's tail.
22	12	You think so? How can we tell the piece fits there?	
22	12		Because it has part of the barn.
22	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece, where should we put this one?	
22	12		Try right here.
22	12	Right here like this?	
22	12	That look right?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No? How should we fix it?	
22	12		Maybe like this.
22	12	There? How'd you know we had to put it there instead of where we had it?	
22	12		Because it fits.
22	12	Okay, how could you tell it fits?	
22	12		Because it's part of the horse.
22	12	Okay. And what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
22	12		Maybe put it right here, see if it fits.
22	12	Put it right here like this?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No? How could you tell it doesn't fit?	
22	12		Try like… that… um… maybe we're not ready for that piece yet?
22	12	We aren't? Okay.	
22	12	Do you have a guess where it could go?	
22	12	Where else could it go?	
22	12	Okay, how'd you know to try it there?	
22	12		Because that is the tail and that's the rest.
22	12	Oh, ok. Got it. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
22	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
22	12		Put it right here, see if it fits.
22	12	Put it right here like this?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
22	12		Try it right here.
22	12	Right there, you think it goes there?	
22	12		Yeah.
22	12	What makes you think that?	
22	12		Because the edges fit.
22	12	Oh, okay. And what about this piece, where should this one go?	
22	12		How about right here.
22	12	Right here like this?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No? How should we fix it?	
22	12		Right here.
22	12	Oh, okay, how'd you that it would fit that way?	
22	12	How could you tell that I put it in wrong?	
22	12		Because it was facing this way.
22	12	Oh, okay, and how could you tell that was wrong?	
22	12		Maybe let's put it right here.
22	12	Oh, okay, how'd you know we had to do that?	
22	12		Because that's part of the horsey's mouth.
22	12	Oh okay, and what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
22	12		I don't think we need, are ready for this piece.
22	12	We aren't, should we save it?	
22	12		Yeah.
22	12	Oh, but you think it might go there?	
22	12	What makes you think that?	
22	12		I think so.
22	12	What makes you think it goes there?	
22	12		Because that's the right way.
22	12	Okay. And what about this piece where should this one go?	
22	12		I don't know.
22	12	You don't know? Do you have a guess?	
22	12		It could go right here.
22	12		But it doesn't.
22	12		It goes right here.
22	12	Good job, and what made you think it might go there?	
22	12	What made you guess that it would go there?	
22	12		It has water but it doesn't go there.
22	12	Oh, ok.	
22	12		That's part of a sheep.
22	12	It is part of a sheep.	
22	12	What should we do with this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
22	12		Put it right here.
22	12	Put it right here like this?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No? How should we fix it?	
22	12	Where did that piece go?	
22	12	Do you think that one's wrong, or do you think we have it in the right place?	
22	12		I think we have it in the right place but this goes on top.
22	12	Oh, you think that one goes on top?	
22	12		And I think we're not ready for that one yet.
22	12	Okay. So what should we do with this piece?	
22	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do?	
22	12		Maybe put it in here.
22	12	Put it where.	
22	12		In here.
22	12	Oh.	
22	12		It fits.
22	12	It does fit, how can we tell it fits?	
22	12		Because…
22	12		That fits.
22	12	Yeah, how could you tell it would go there?	
22	12		That corn is on the floor.
22	12	It is on the floor, isn't it.	
22	12	And what should we do with this piece?	
22	12		That one, put it right here.
22	12	Put it right here like this?	
22	12		no.
22	12	No?	
22	12		Put it right here like this.
22	12	What'd you do to fix it?	
22	12		I put it the right way.
22	12	Oh, okay. And what about this piece, where should this one go?	
22	12		Put it right here.
22	12	Right here like this?	
22	12		No.
22	12	No, how should we fix it.	
22	12	Put it that way, okay, how'd you know it would go that way and not the way that I put it in?	
22	12		Because that's the right way it's facing.
22	12	Oh, okay, great job.	
22	12		And that's put together.
23	12	Okay. So this one we're going to do a little differently, okay?	
23	12	We're going to play a game with it.	
23	12	So what we're going to do in this game is I have the puzzle pieces stacked, okay?	
23	12	What we're going to do is I'm going to put the pieces in and you're going to tell me where they go.	
23	12	And this is what the puzzle's going to look like when we're all done, okay?	
23	12		Okay. This!
23	12	Yeah, you ready to start?	
23	12		Yeah.
23	12	Okay, and make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, okay?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Okay well here is our first piece, what should I do with it?	
23	12	Think it goes here?	
23	12	Oh, can you use your words and tell me what to do?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Here like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	No, how should we fix it?	
23	12		turn it around.
23	12	Oh, turn it around like that, okay, how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
23	12	How could you tell?	
23	12		Because you're doing it like this.
23	12	Okay, and why is that wrong?	
23	12		Because this facing up and this supposed to be facing up and this supposed to be in the corner.
23	12	Oh, that's supposed to be in the corner? Okay.	
23	12	What should we do with this piece?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Right here like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	What should we do to fix it?	
23	12		Turn it around.
23	12	Turn it around like that?	
23	12		And then…
23	12	Okay, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
23	12		Because they all ###
23	12	Oh, ok.	
23	12		Cause, uh, matching.
23	12	Because matching?	
23	12	Okay, what about this piece.	
23	12		Uh, that one go over here.
23	12	Goes right here?	
23	12		Yes, ###.
23	12	And how'd you know it needed to go there?	
23	12		Because.
23	12	Because why?	
23	12		I found the horse.
23	12	You found the horse?	
23	12		The horse is not complete.
23	12		Or the duck.
23	12	Okay. So what should we do with this piece, can you use your words and tell me?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Go here like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	No, how should I fix it?	
23	12		Turn it around, like that.
23	12	Turn it around, okay, and how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
23	12		Because you were doing it like this.
23	12		The cat was facing this way.
23	12	Oh, okay. What about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Right here like that?	
23	12		Yes.
23	12	Oh okay, and how'd you figure that out?	
23	12		Because I'm watching that puzzle, that puzzle.
23	12	Okay, but how'd you know it needed to go there?	
23	12		Cause, I watched that last puzzle on top of the…
23	12	Okay, well let's try to not look at the picture, okay?	
23	12	Can you tell me where this piece should go?	
23	12		There?
23	12		Can I put it in?
23	12	Okay, help me put it in.	
23	12		There.
23	12	Okay, and how'd you know it needed to go there?	
23	12		Because I saw the, I saw that picture.
23	12	Okay, and what about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12		Go right here.
23	12	It should go right here like this?	
23	12		I was wrong.
23	12	You were wrong? How could you tell you were wrong?	
23	12		Because…
23	12	What?	
23	12		Probably go over here.
23	12	It should go over here? Like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	No? How could we tell that one's wrong?	
23	12		Turn around.
23	12	Turn around?	
23	12		No.
23	12	Not right?	
23	12	Oh, how do we know it needs to go there?	
23	12		Because…
23	12	Because why?	
23	12		Because I didn't saw that picture with this piece.
23	12	Okay, but how could you tell it didn't go there?	
23	12		Because it has a corner.
23	12		I thought it goes here, but it goes there.
23	12	Okay, and why'd you think it went there?	
23	12		Because these two corners work the same, and these two corners look the same.
23	12	Oh, the corners look the same?	
23	12	Okay, what about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12		I don't know… here.
23	12	Here, like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
23	12		Because I'm wrong.
23	12	You're wrong? But how do we know you're wrong?	
23	12		Because I can't ## that corner… this corner.
23	12	Oh, okay. So where do you think that this piece should go.	
23	12		Here.
23	12	It should go here like this?	
23	12		Can I put it in?
23	12	So I put it in wrong, how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
23	12		Because I saw that picture over there.
23	12	Okay, and what about this piece, where should this one go?	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Right here like this?	
23	12		No.
23	12	No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
23	12		I'm wrong again.
23	12	That's okay, but how can we tell you're wrong?	
23	12		Because that corner looked the same and this corner look the same.
23	12	Oh, okay, so it should go here like this?	
23	12		Yeah, can I put it in?
23	12		I'm pretty good at puzzles.
23	12	Yeah? So how'd you fix it? 	
23	12		Because…
23	12	How'd you make it fit?	
23	12		I find that picture.
23	12	Okay, and how did you make that piece fit there.	
23	12		Because I doing like that.
23	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
23	12		Go right here.
23	12		Can I put it in?
23	12	There, and how'd you know that piece would go there?	
23	12		The pig is complete.
23	12	The pig is complete.	
23	12		Not the horse, the horse is not complete.
23	12	Okay, where should we put this piece.	
23	12		Right here.
23	12	Goes right here like this?	
23	12		Nope. I'm going to put it in the right way.
23	12	Oh, and how'd you know that was the right way in	
23	12		Why is there water here?
23	12	I don’t know.	
23	12	How could you tell that I put it in the wrong way.	
23	12		Because this was facing up where the horse was.
23	12	Okay, and what's wrong with that?	
23	12		Because, I don't know.
23	12	You don't know?	
23	12	Okay. And what about this last piece, where should this one go.	
23	12		Here.
23	12	Here like this?	
23	12		I put it in.
23	12		I'll put it in the right way.
23	12	Okay, and what'd you have to do to make it the right way?	
23	12		Because I switched it.
23	12	You switched it?	
23	12		Yeah.
23	12	Good job.	
23	12		Now we're going to do the next puzzle?
24	12	So I'm gonna show you how to play a game with this puzzle, okay?	
24	12	And I'm gonna scoot over to play this with you.	
24	12	Okay, so what I did with this puzzle is I stacked all the pieces, okay?	
24	12		I ###
24	12	What?	
24	12		Just like a rock star… (he's singing)
24	12	What's that from?	
24	12		We are just like a rock star…
24	12		First grade band.
24	12	Oh really, okay.	
24	12		I sang that song for twenty hours!
24	12	Wow, that's a long time.	
24	12		And everyone else ### (sings)
24	12	Okay, you ready to play our puzzle game?	
24	12		Mm-hm.
24	12	Okay, so I stacked all the pieces and what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me	
24	12		Why did you stack all the pieces?
24	12	Well because you're going to tell me where to put the pieces  and I'm going to put them in, okay?	
24	12		Ok.
24	12	And make sure to use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do.	
24	12		It's another farm one!
24	12	Yeah, and this is what it's going to look like when we're all done.	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	Ready to start?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12		Let's count back from ten. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
24	12	Ready to start?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	Okay, this is our first piece, where should it go.	
24	12		It should go right here.
24	12	Okay, like this?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	And how'd you know it would go there?	
24	12		Because it's a corner.
24	12	Oh okay, and how could you tell it's a corner.	
24	12		Because it has a point.
24	12	Oh, okay I got it.	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	and what about this piece, where should we put this one.	
24	12		It goes right here.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		Mm-hm, uh… yeah!
24	12	What'd you do to fix it?	
24	12	How'd you make it fit?	Because it has a little red on it.
24	12	Oh, okay good job.	
24	12		I did it.
24	12	You did it.	
24	12	Can you tell me where to put this piece?	
24	12		Right there.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12		No, it's upside down.
24	12	Oh, it's upside down, how can you tell it's upside down?	
24	12		Because the horse is, oh, we did it!
24	12		It goes here.
24	12	Oh, okay, good job.	
24	12	How could you tell it went here and not where we had it?	
24	12		Because it has the feet.
24	12	Oh, okay. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one?	
24	12		Oh, I don't know.
24	12	You don't know? Can you take a guess?	
24	12	Where do you think it should go?	
24	12		Hmm, right over here.
24	12	Here like this?	
24	12		No. I think it should be like this.
24	12	You think it should be like this?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	Oh okay, and how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
24	12		Because it was upside down.
24	12	Oh okay so what did you have to do to fix it?	
24	12		Do it right side up so that up is down.
24	12	Oh, got it.	
24	12	Can you tell me what I should do with this piece?	
24	12		Yeah, the pig.
24	12	Yeah,where do you think the pig should go?	
24	12		I don't know, I don't see any pig spots.
24	12	So can you take a guess where you think this piece could go?	
24	12		I don't think, I don't think so.
24	12	No, should we save it for later?	
24	12		No.
24	12	So should we save it?	
24	12		No.
24	12	So do you think you can find where it goes now?	
24	12		Right here.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		No, this doesn't go there, silly.
24	12	How can you tell it doesn't go there?	
24	12	I thought you said it would go there.	
24	12		No, I can't figure it out.
24	12	Okay, we'll save it for later.	
24	12		No.
24	12		Doesn't go there.
24	12		This is a corner also.
24	12		Because it has a point.
24	12	And so where should we put it?	
24	12		It goes right there.
24	12	Oh, how do you know it has to go there?	
24	12		Because it's a corner.
24	12	Oh, okay.	
24	12		I told you that.
24	12	Got it.	
24	12		My eyes are brown.
24	12		So are yours.
24	12	So are mine.	
24	12	We both have brown eyes.	
24	12	Okay, can you find where this piece should go?	
24	12		Right there.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		Right in the middle.
24	12		Up, right side up.
24	12		Tada.
24	12	Oh okay, and how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
24	12		Because it was upside down.
24	12	Okay. And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
24	12		It should be right over there.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		Uh, I don't see a cow spot.
24	12	So where do you, do you have a guess for where that could go?	
24	12		It could go right over here.
24	12	Right there?	
24	12		No, no, not there.
24	12		I see a little other spot.
24	12	Oh, okay so where do you think that piece could go then?	
24	12		A cow!
24	12		I don't see a cow.
24	12	So should we save it for later?	
24	12		No. I think there's a cow spot.
24	12	Well we're not going to look at the picture, we're going to try to do it without the picture, okay?	
24	12		Okay.
24	12	So if you want you can make it	
24	12		Go right here.
24	12	What makes you think it goes there?	
24	12		Because it's a corner.
24	12		And it has a point.
24	12	Oh, got it.	
24	12		See that corner?
24	12	And why doesn't it go here?	
24	12		Because it there's no point right there.
24	12	Oh okay, got it.	
24	12	Okay and what about this piece where should this one go.	
24	12		I don't know.
24	12	You don't know? Do you have a guess where it could go?	
24	12		Yeah, it's a sheep piece.
24	12	So where do you think the sheep would go.	
24	12		Right there.
24	12	Right here like this?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12		Oh, that doesn't fit.
24	12	How could you tell that doesn't fit?	
24	12		Because it's too wide and look right here.
24	12		But it is a corner.
24	12	Okay, so where do you think it should go?	
24	12	We could save it.	
24	12		No.
24	12	Do you have a guess where it could go?	
24	12	Should we just make a guess and if it's wrong we can change it later?	
24	12		Nope.
24	12	No?	
24	12	Let's save it.	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	What about this piece, where should this one go?	
24	12		Oh, right here.
24	12	There?	
24	12		Nah.
24	12	No?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	There we go, good job.	
24	12	Okay, what made you try it there first?	
24	12		Because I thought it goes there but it doesn't.
24	12	Okay and how could you tell it didn't go there?	
24	12		Because there's no line.
24	12	Oh okay. So what about this piece, where should this one go?	
24	12		It should go right there.
24	12	It should go right here like this?	
24	12	Okay, and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
24	12		Because the chicken is on the cow's back.
24	12	And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
24	12		It should go right over here.
24	12	Okay, how'd you know it needed to go that way?	
24	12		Because it goes, it has one line.
24	12		And the mama duck's feet are right there.
24	12	Got it, and what about this piece where should this one go?	
24	12		It goes right there.
24	12	Goes right here?	
24	12		Yeah.
24	12	Kay how'd you know those pieces would match?	
24	12		Because they don't go together.
24	12		Look, a baby chick.
24	12	Yeah. So this piece, where does that one go now.	
25	12	See, this is the next one.	
25	12		You can do it all by yourself.
25	12	Well, you're going to help me, I'll tell you how you're gonna help me.	
25	12	So I have the puzzle	
25	12		I'm done looking yet.
25	12	You're done looking at this one?	
25	12		when I'm done.
25	12	You're done? Should we put it on the floor?	
25	12		We can't put it on the floor yet, I'm still
25	12	What if we put it over here, so you can still look at it?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	We can put it like this.	
25	12	Can you have a seat on your chair?	
25	12		###, look at it
25	12	Okay, can I explain how we're going to do this next puzzle? It's a really fun game, okay?	
25	12	So I have the puzzle pieces stacked, okay?	
25	12	And what we're gonna do is you're going to tell me where to put the pieces and I'm going to put them in, okay?	
25	12		Okay.
25	12	But make sure to use your words cuz I'm only going to do what you tell me to do.	
25	12	And this is what the puzzle's going to look like when we're all done.	
25	12		Mm-hm.
25	12	Okay? You ready to start?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	Okay, okay.	
25	12		He's got a long neck.
25	12	Yeah, ok but this is our first piece for the other puzzle, what should I do with it?	
25	12		Put it on the top.
25	12	Okay, so where should I put it, can you show me?	
25	12		Right there.
25	12	Right here like this?	
25	12	Does that look right?	
25	12	Okay. And why do you think it goes there?	
25	12		Because you can't go put it down.
25	12	We can't? Why not? Why can't we put it down?	
25	12		Because the ###... The… the… if we don't… the pieces will fall out.
25	12	Oh, ok. So we should leave it here, or we should put it where it was? Where should we put it.	
25	12		Right here.
25	12	Right here like this? Ok.	
25	12	And what about this piece what should we do with this one?	
25	12	Oh, ok and how'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12		Because that opens up.
25	12	Because what opens up?	
25	12		The door.
25	12	Oh, the door opens up? Okay.	
25	12	And what about this next piece what should I do with this one?	
25	12		Put it down here.
25	12	Down here like that?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	That look great?	
25	12		Put it over here like this.
25	12	Oh, ok and how'd you know it would go there and not where we had it?	
25	12	How'd you figure that out?	
25	12		Because we have to go there. ## put it away.
25	12		And no one could flip it over.
25	12	Oh, ok. Won't let you flip it over.	
25	12	What should we do with this piece.	
25	12	Right there?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	Oh and how did you know that piece would match there?	
25	12		Because it fits there.
25	12	But how did you know it'd fit there?	
25	12		Because no flip it over here.
25	12	Oh, ok.	
25	12		### be scared.
25	12	Ok so what about this next piece what should we do with that one.	
25	12		Put it right here.
25	12	Right here? Like this?	
25	12		Pigs go oink oink.
25	12	Yeah, ok. So why'd you put that piece there, what made you put it there?	
25	12		You keep it there, not flip it over.
25	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
25	12		I knew where the head goes.
25	12	The head goes there?	
25	12		You can't ## flip it over.
25	12		Kinda scared of the dark. You have to stay out of the room.
25	12	Oh, ok.	
25	12		Kind of scared of the… ######
25	12	Yeah? How'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12	How'd you know we had to put it here?	
25	12		Because it has to go, to go
25	12	Because it has to go there?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	Ok.	
25	12	And what about that piece, where does that one go.	
25	12		Right here.
25	12	Right there? Why do you think it goes there.	
25	12		Because… ### taken away.
25	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
25	12		Here.
25	12	There like that?	
25	12		Here. Next to the cow here.
25	12	Next to the cow piece?	
25	12	Why do you think it goes next to the cow piece?	
25	12		Because ## should always take it apart.
25	12	And what about this piece, where should that one go.	
25	12		Right here.
25	12	Right there?	
25	12		There?
25	12	Hmm.	
25	12		It does go right here.
25	12	Yeah, I think it goes there. How'd you know it would go there?	
25	12	What made you try it there?	
25	12		No one.
25	12	No one?	
25	12		Yeah, tried it all by myself.
25	12	Yeah, but why'd you try it there all by yourself?	
25	12	What made you think it would go there?	
25	12		The sun is out.
25	12	The sun's out? It is out.	
25	12	So you think these pieces go here or should we fix those?	
25	12		Mhm. I think that this go there.
25	12	You think they go there? Ok.	
25	12	So what about this piece where should this one go?	
25	12	Oh, good job. How'd you know those pieces would match?	
25	12	How'd you figure that out?	
25	12	Oh, and that one goes there?	
25	12	How'd you figure out that that piece went there?	
25	12		Because it don't attach the other way
25	12	Oh okay. And where should that piece go.	
25	12		Right here.
25	12	Right there?	
25	12		Can we use the next piece of the…
25	12	Yeah. How'd you know that piece would go there?	
25	12		Because that's the cat.
25	12	That's the cat?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	Oh ok, so what about this piece, can I take a turn and you tell me where I should put this piece?	
25	12	Right there?	
25	12		Yeah.
25	12	Ok and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
25	12		Yeah give me the last piece.
25	12	The last piece? Here it is.	
25	12	How should that one go in?	
25	12		That.
25	12	There we go, good job.	
26	12	Well this one we're going to do a little differently, okay, we're going to play a game with it.	
26	12		What's the game?
26	12	Well I'm gonna have to scoot over for this game.	
26	12		What?
26	12	I'm gonna have to scoot over for this game.	
26	12	Okay so what I've done is I've stacked the pieces, okay?	
26	12	And so what we're gonna do is you're going to tell me where to put the pieces and I'm going to put them in, okay?	
26	12	And make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, okay?	
26	12	And this is what the puzzle's going to look like when we're all done.	
26	12	Okay, you ready to start?	
26	12		Yeah.
26	12	Yeah?	
26	12		That's the example thing?
26	12	Yeah but I'm gonna turn this over so we can't see it, okay?	
26	12		Why?
26	12	So it'll be more fun. So it'll be more challenging.	
26	12		But that won't be more fun for me.
26	12	It won't? Well, let's try it, okay?	
26	12		No.
26	12	We'll give it a try, ok?	
26	12	Ok, you've just gotta try to remember.	
26	12	Okay, so here's our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
26	12		Put it there.
26	12	Right here? Ok. And how'd you know it would go there?	
26	12		Because of the example. I remember the example
26	12	Okay so what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12		Here.
26	12	Here like this?	
26	12		Nah!
26	12	No? What should I do to fix it?	
26	12		Put it here.
26	12	Here like this?	
26	12	That look right?	
26	12		No. That's…
26	12	Hmm. So how should we fix it.	
26	12	Where could we put it.	
26	12		I need the example.
26	12	Well let's see. Let's look at these pieces. How do you think they could fit together?	
26	12		Try both.
26	12	No? Let's see. Oh.	
26	12	How'd you know we had to put it that way?	
26	12		Because we see a little bit of the barn.
26	12	The barn? Ok. So here is our next piece, what should I do with this one?	
26	12	Where should this one go?	
26	12		I want the example.
26	12	Well can you let's see. Think about it without the example, where could you put this one.	
26	12	Just look at the pieces.	
26	12	Do you have a guess for where this one could go?	
26	12		No.
26	12	You sure? Should we save it for later?	
26	12		Ah.
26	12	You think it should go there?	
26	12	That look right?	
26	12	Hmm, where could that piece go?	
26	12	Hmm? You have another guess where it could go?	
26	12		No I don't… have any guesses for the puzzle
26	12	Okay well we can save that piece for later.	
26	12	How about this piece where should this one go.	
26	12		I don't have a guess for it.
26	12	You don't? Are you sure? 	
26	12	Where could that piece go?	
26	12		Maybe it goes…
26	12	Go there?	
26	12		Or… here.
26	12	There?	
26	12		Or here.
26	12	Oh, how'd you know it'd fit there?	
26	12		Because I see like boop.
26	12	What is that? What do you see?	
26	12		I don't know what that is.
26	12	You don't know? We'll wait and see.	
26	12	Okay, now, do you have a guess for where this one could go now?	
26	12	Where do you think this one could go?	
26	12		Don't know.
26	12	You don't know yet? Ok.	
26	12	How about this piece where should this one go.	
26	12	You don't have a guess yet?	
26	12		I don't have a guess.
26	12	Ok.	
26	12		I think that we're just flying through it.
26	12	Yeah? Where does this piece go?	
26	12	Are you sure you don't know where this one goes yet? Take a good look at it.	
26	12	Oh! How'd you know to try it there?	
26	12		Because we see brown, brown brown edge.
26	12	Oh, ok.	
26	12	So what about this piece, do we have a guess for where this one could go yet?	
26	12	Oh, and how'd you know those pieces would match.	
26	12		Cause, pig, pig.
26	12	Ok. And this piece, do we know where this one goes yet.	
26	12	No.	
26	12	And what about this piece, do we know where this one should go?	
26	12	Right here, like this?	
26	12		No.
26	12	Like that?	
26	12	Where should that one go.	
26	12	Ok, how'd you know to try it there?	
26	12		Because brown, brown.
26	12	Browns match? Ok.	
26	12	So what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12	Can you tell me where this piece should go?	
26	12	Keep these here.	
26	12	Where should this piece go?	
26	12	You don't know yet? Take a good look. Where do you think this piece should go.	
26	12	Can I try it? Can you tell me where I should try it?	
26	12	Here like this?	
26	12		No, like that.
26	12	Hmm… where else could we try that piece.	
26	12	Oh, how'd you know to try it there?	
26	12		Because… pig, pig pig pig.
26	12	Oh, ok. And this piece, do we know where this one should go yet?	
26	12	Not yet? Ok.	
26	12	What about this one?	
26	12		That one give me an idea.
26	12	Yeah?	
26	12	Think it should go there?	
26	12		Go there, there…
26	12	Hmm. Where should we put that piece.	
26	12		Couple options.
26	12	Yeah.	
26	12		### right here?
26	12	Think it goes there?	
26	12		Here?
26	12		Is that right?
26	12	It might go there?	
26	12	Why do you think it goes there?	
26	12	What makes you think that?	
26	12		Ah, that?
26	12	Oh, I think that's right.	
26	12	How do we know that it goes there like that and not the other way.	
26	12	Not the way you had it.	
26	12	How do we know that this way looks better.	
26	12		There we go.
26	12	Oh, and how'd we know this piece had to go this way and not the other way around?	
26	12		Because there's a hole.
26	12	Oh, ok.	
26	12	And what about this piece, where should this one go.	
26	12	Can you use your words and tell me where you're putting it?	
26	12	Oh, and how'd you know it would match there.	
26	12		Because there's duck duck.
26	12	Oh ok. So what about this piece, can you use your words to tell me where to put this one? I want to take a turn.	
26	12	Right here like this?	
26	12		No, like this.
26	12	Oh, ok.	
26	12		Oh.
26	12		I think it's like this.
26	12	Oh okay, and how could we tell it had to go here and not here?

26	12	Good job.	
27	12	But we're going to play a game with this one, ok? Whoops!	
27	12	So what we're going to do with this one, I'm going to scoot over for it	
27	12	Yeah. So I have the puzzle pieces stacked, okay, and what we're going to do is I'm going to put the pieces in, but you have to tell me where to put them, ok?	
27	12	But make sure you use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok?	
27	12	And this is what it's going to look like when it's all done.	
27	12		Ok. ### match!
27	12	Yeah. You ready to start?	
27	12		Yeah.
27	12	Ok. So here is our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Right here, and how'd you know it would go there?	
27	12	How'd you figure that out?	
27	12		I don't know.
27	12	You don't know?	
27	12		No, I didn't
27	12	And what about this piece, what should I do with this one	
27	12		Over here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No? How should I fix it?	
27	12		Turns.
27	12	Turn it?	
27	12		Yeah.
27	12	How'd you know I put it in wrong?	
27	12		Um I know since they go match.
27	12	Oh, you make it match?	
27	12	And what about this piece where does this one go	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No?	
27	12		Like that.
27	12	Oh, ok what'd you have to do to fix it?	
27	12		You turn it around, see? And they'll match the piece.
27	12	Match the piece? Ok.	
27	12	And what about this piece where does this one go	
27	12		Right… right… this part.
27	12	Right here?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
27	12		Right there!
27	12	Oh, ok and how could you tell it was wrong there?	
27	12		I'm smart!
27	12	You're smart? Ok.	
27	12	What about this piece? Where should this one go?	
27	12		Add this right here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No?	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Oh, ok.	
27	12		She's jelly.
27	12	Oh, and what made you try it there?	
27	12	Why'd you think it would go there?	
27	12		I kinda guessed.
27	12		I couldn't change it!
27	12	You couldn't change it? Ok.	
27	12	What about this piece, can you tell me what to do with it?	
27	12		Right here!
27	12	Right here?	
27	12		Yeah.
27	12	How'd you know those pieces would match?	
27	12		Oh, because I go my house and I figure my puzzles.
27	12	Oh, ok. And what about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
27	12		Um, right here.
27	12	Right here?	
27	12		Yeah.
27	12	Oh, how'd you know it had to go there? Huh?	
27	12		I don't know.
27	12	You don't know? Why didn't we wanna try it there?	
27	12	How'd you know it wouldn't go there?	
27	12		Go right here.
27	12		I didn't make this corner and then I make that corner.
27	12	Oh, make that corner and the other corner?	
27	12	What about this piece where should this one go?	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	right here? And how'd you know it had to go there?	
27	12		Because I, took the pieces and came the sides.
27	12	Oh, ok. And what about this piece, where should this one go?	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		Oh, like that.
27	12	That?	
27	12	Oh, ok, and how'd you know it couldn’t go there?	
27	12		It doesn't shape like that.
27	12	Oh, like what.	
27	12		###. Like the face, it go my house.
27	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece where should we put this one	
27	12		There.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No. Turn a little more.
27	12		Like that.
27	12	Oh, what'd you do to fix it?	
27	12		Cause it matches.
27	12	Matches? Ok.	
27	12	How could we tell it matches there?	
27	12		Because the black and the black.
27	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece.	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No? how do we fix it.	
27	12		Gotta turn like this.
27	12	Turn it like that?	
27	12		No.
27	12	Ok how did we know it had to go that way?	
27	12		I can, because, under goes the way ### it goes, this and… it can't be backwards!
27	12	It can't be backwards? Ok.	
27	12		Right here.
27	12	Right here like this?	
27	12		No.
27	12	No? How do we fix it?	
27	12		You see ###!
27	12	There we go, good job.	
28	12	Ok so let me explain how we're going to do this puzzle, ok?	
28	12		You have to keep close.
28	12	We're going to play a game with this one, ok?	
28	12	So what I did is I stacked the pieces and you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm going to put them in ok?	
28	12	But make sure to use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do.	
28	12		You have to…
28	12	And this is what it's gonna look like when it's all done ok?	
28	12		Oh… are those
28	12	Ok. But I  already have the pieces here so we're gonna put this one on the ground.	
28	12		Are those the extra pieces?
28	12	Yeah. Oh, but we already took them apart so we're going to put this one on the ground, this is just an example.	
28	12	Ok. So here is our first piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
28	12		You can put it right here if you want.
28	12	Right here like this? Ok.	
28	12	And why do you think it goes there?	
28	12		Because it's maybe top of the barn.
28	12	It's the top of the barn?	
28	12		No. We have to find out where this…
28	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do with this piece?	
28	12	Put it here like this?	
28	12		Uh, no, turn it around.
28	12	No? Turn it around?	
28	12		Yup.
28	12	Oh, ok.	
28	12		Doesn't match.
28	12	Doesn't match? So what should we do with it do you think.	
28	12		Maybe we could put it 
28	12		There's no more pieces.
28	12	So what do you think we should do with this one.	
28	12		Oh, I know. Maybe we should go like this.
28	12	Go like that? Ok why do you think those pieces go like that?	
28	12		Because they maybe match.
28	12	They maybe match? Ok	
28	12		Well we have to find out if they don't match, we have to start all over again.
28	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
28	12		Maybe we could put it right here.
28	12	Right here like this?	
28	12		Uh, no, like this.
28	12	Oh like that?	
28	12		Yep.
28	12	Ok why do you think it goes there?	
28	12		Because the bird maybe wants to go this way.
28	12	Oh ok. So what about this piece, where should we put this one?	
28	12		I think we should put it right here.
28	12	Put it right here like this?	
28	12		Yup. But maybe like this.
28	12	Oh, like that? Ok. Why do you think it goes that way?	
28	12		Because maybe it wants to go this way to the barn.
28	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one.	
28	12		I think we should put it right here.
28	12	Right there?	
28	12		Yup.
28	12	Ok why do you think it goes there?	
28	12		Because it maybe matches.
28	12	Maybe matches?	
28	12		Uh, we have to start…
28	12	What about this one?	
28	12		Maybe goes right here but there's no room.
28	12	Oh ok.	
28	12		We have to take the barn away  this way
28	12	And this one too?	
28	12		and pick this.
28	12	Ok. So where are we putting that piece?	
28	12		I think…
28	12	Oh, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
28	12		Because they're the same size. Look.
28	12		This piece is the same as this so you put them together and they match.
28	12	Oh ok, got it.	
28	12	Ok now what about these other pieces do we know where we should put those	
28	12		The pig maybe goes right here.
28	12	There? Oh ok. How'd you know to put it there?	
28	12		Because it matches.
28	12	Ok. What about that piece.	
28	12		Now maybe the duck goes here it doesn't match
28	12		The kitty goes… oh it's not part.
28	12	How do we know it doesn't match there?	
28	12		Because this goes like neeaaw and this only goes like neeaaw
28	12	Oh ok.	
28	12	What about this piece, do we know where this one could go yet	
28	12		I maybe you put it right here.
28	12	Oh ok how'd you know it had to go there.	
28	12		Because it's part of the barn.
28	12	Ok so what about these other pieces do we know where these should go yet	
28	12		Oh maybe the kitty cat goes right here.
28	12	There? You think that fits?	
28	12		No.
28	12	Hmm should we wait on that one?	
28	12		Maybe we have to do a Thomas puzzle like at my home.
28	12	Well we're just going to do this puzzle ok?	
28	12	What about this piece where do you think this one goes?	
28	12		Oh, maybe here.
28	12	Maybe there?	
28	12		Nope.
28	12	No? Where else do you think it could go?	
28	12		Here. Hey.
28	12	What made you try it in all those places?	
28	12	What made you think it could go there in those places?	
28	12		Because they almost match.
28	12	Oh ok.	
28	12		Because this goes like neewwp and this goes like bzzuuut
28	12	Ok. But they don't match?	
28	12		No.
28	12	Why not.	
28	12		Because it goes like bzzuut and this goes like zzzuuuuuu
28	12	Hm. Got it. Okay well what about if I put this piece here.	
28	12		Matches!
28	12	That matches. And what about if we put this piece, do you have an idea where this one could go now?	
28	12		Here.
28	12	There?	
28	12		Oh. Saves…
28	12	Go there?	
28	12		Maybe? Like… there's no match.
28	12	There's no match?	
28	12		Maybe…
28	12	Oh.	
28	12		Yeah.
28	12	Ok how do you know that matches.	
28	12		Because it has the same order.
28	12	Oh same order ok. So what about this piece do we know where this one should go?	
28	12		Uh maybe right here.
28	12	There?	
28	12		Oh doesn't match.
28	12	How could you tell it doesn't match?	
28	12		Because it… Because thingy has to be part of it but this is not part of the pig and the horse
28	12	Oh ok so should we wait for this piece?	
28	12		Yeah.
28	12	Ok we'll put it on the side.	
28	12		Hey what's that noise?
28	12	It's the heater. It makes noises.	
28	12	Where do you think this piece should go?	
28	12		Raahhh!
28	12	Oh, gosh.	
28	12	Where do you think this piece should go?	
28	12	Here? Like this?	
28	12		Yes.
28	12		Maybe like…
28	12	Oh ok. Cool how could we know it couldn't go here and had to go there?	
28	12		Because it matched.
28	12	What matches.	
28	12		This match with… this doesn't match with this so it match
28	12	Why doesn't it match with that one	
28	12		I don't know
28	12	You don't know? Ok so what about these other two pieces do we know where these should go yet	
28	12		No.
28	12	No? Should we still wait on those? Ok.	
28	12		Oh, maybe it goes here. There's lots of holes.
28	12	Lots of holes?	
28	12		Oo, yep.
28	12	How'd you know you could try it there?	
28	12		I don't know.
28	12	You don't know?	
28	12		Hey.
28	12	Where should that piece go?	
28	12		I don't know.
28	12	You don't know?	
28	12		It goes here.
28	12	You think it goes there?	
28	12		Maybe it's too much space because of the duck.
28	12	Too much space because of the duck? Ok.	
28	12	So should we wait on this piece still?	
28	12	So what about this one where do you think this piece should go.	
28	12		Not there…
28	12	Think it goes there?	
28	12		I don't, oh maybe this piece…
28	12		There.
28	12	How'd you know those pieces would match?	
28	12		Because it matches with the pig.
28	12	Matches with the pig? Ok.	
28	12		We're almost done we only have
28	12	We are.	
28	12		One, two,
28	12	Three more pieces.	
28	12		Three, four.
28	12	We only have three left. Where do you think this one should go.	
28	12		Right…
28	12	Why do we know that doesn't go like that.	
28	12	How could we tell.	
28	12		Because it doesn’t match.
28	12	Oh ok.	
28	12		Huh maybe it goes…
28	12	Oh how'd you know it had to go there?	
28	12		Because it matches.
28	12		And maybe this piece goes here.
28	12	How does that one go.	
28	12	Think it fits there?	
28	12		Yeah.
28	12	Yeah?	
28	12		Maybe this…
28	12		I'm ## very good at puzzles.
28	12	It go there?	
28	12	There we go. How could you tell it didn't go there.	
28	12		Because it didn't match.
28	12		It only has sssss and this one has nooowwww.
28	12	Oh ok. So what about this last piece where should we put this one.	
28	12		Here.
28	12	Here like this?	
28	12		No.
28	12	No? Oh there we go how'd you make it fit?	
28	12		I don't know.
28	12	You don't know?	
28	12		We're done with all of the puzzles!
29	12	So the next thing we're gonna do is, can you scoot over a little so I can sit by you?	
29	12	Here, I'm gonna scoot you a little.	
29	12	Is that okay? Alright. Here we go.	
29	12	So I'm going to show you a game to play with this puzzle.

29	12	And I'm going to stack up all the pieces for this puzzle, ok?	
29	12	And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a piece and you're going to tell me where you think it should go, ok?	
29	12		ok.
29	12	So. I'm only going to do what you tell me to do so make sure to use your words to tell me where the piece goes, ok?

29	12	ok we should get another piece you think?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	ok we'll do that piece later?	
29	12		Yeah I think
29	12	ok what about this piece.	
29	12		right here.
29	12	Right here?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	Like that?	
29	12		Doesn't fit.
29	12	It doesn't fit. Ok. What should I try next.	
29	12		Another one.
29	12	Another piece?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12		That's too big… here you go.
29	12	What about this?

29	12		Put it over here.
29	12	Put it here?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12		Hmm. It doesn't fit.
29	12	It doesn't fit? That's ok.	
29	12	Do you want to do some puzzle pieces--puzzles with your mom now?	
29	12		No.
29	12	You wanna finish this one?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	Ok. Let's try to put it over here.	
29	12	How about that?	
29	12	Look at this piece.	
29	12	It goes here?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	I think you might be go like that?	
29	12		Yeah, that's better.
29	12	That piece go there?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	What about this one, where does this one go?	
29	12	Here?	
29	12		Yeah.
29	12	What about this one?	
29	12	Yay, great job you finished it!	
30	12	So for this game I've the puzzle pieces stacked.	
30	12	And what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm going to put them in, ok?	
30	12		Ok.
30	12	Ok but make sure you use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok?	
30	12		ok.
30	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
30	12	Ok you ready to start?	
30	12		Yes. Those are the same puzzles.
30	12	It is, yeah.	
30	12	Ok so what do you think we should do with this first piece?	
30	12		Over here.
30	12	Over here?	
30	12	Ok, and how'd you know it would go like that?	
30	12		Because this corner is like this.
30	12	Ok, and how could you tell it's a corner?	
30	12		Because the corner is like faced at like this when it's turned like that and if this is the same then you have to put it with the same corners.
30	12	Oh, ok, got it. And what do you think we should do with this piece?	
30	12		Um, put it over here.
30	12	Put it over here like this?	
30	12		No.
30	12	No? How do we fix it?	
30	12		There.
30	12	Oh, how'd you make it fit?	
30	12		Because this piece is round like this.
30	12	That piece is round like that? Ok.	
30	12	And what do you think we should do with this piece?	
30	12		Um…
30	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
30	12		You should put it like this because that's how it fits with this part. Like this.
30	12	Oh, so this part should fit right here?	
30	12	That look right?	
30	12		There's a little green over there.
30	12	There's a little green over there? So what should we do with that?	
30	12	Oh, ok. How'd you know we needed to try it there?	
30	12		Because this part had a little green over there.
30	12	Oh, ok. And what about this piece. What do you think we should do with it?	
30	12		Um, we should put it over here.
30	12	Put it over here like this?	
30	12		Nope.
30	12	No?	
30	12		Like this.
30	12	Like that, how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
30	12		Because you put it like this.
30	12	And why was that wrong?	
30	12		Because this part was, this part was this is, was the black tail. The black tail was supposed to go behind the body.
30	12	Oh, the black tail was supposed to go behind the body? Ok.	
30	12	What about this piece, where do you think we should try this one?	
30	12		Um…
30	12	Where could this one go?	
30	12	Do you have a guess?	
30	12	No? Should we save it for later?	
30	12	What do you think about this piece, where should we try this one.	
30	12		Over here.
30	12	Right here like this?	
30	12		Nope.
30	12	No.	
30	12		Turn it.
30	12	Turn it, ok.	
30	12		Because this is the face.
30	12	Oh ok, and how could you tell we had to turn it.	
30	12		Because this part is the face of the horse.
30	12	Ok. What about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
30	12	Should we make a guess? Where do you think it could go?	
30	12	If it's not right, we can change it later but where do you think this piece could go.	
30	12	You wanna guess?	
30	12		I don't have it.
30	12	You don't know? Ok.	
30	12	Do you have a guess where this one could go now?	
30	12		Um, over here.
30	12	Over here like this?	
30	12		Nope.
30	12	No?	
30	12		We gotta turn it there.
30	12	We gotta turn it?	
30	12	Ok, and how'd you know we had to turn it?	
30	12		Because this is the body of it.
30	12	Oh, ok. Got it. Do we know where we should put this piece yet?	
30	12	Do we have an idea?	
30	12		I don’t think…
30	12	You don't know? That's fine.	
30	12	Where do you think we should try this piece?	
30	12		The lamb…
30	12	Where should the lamb go?	
30	12		I think over here.
30	12	You think over here like this?	
30	12	Oh, ok. How'd you fix it?	
30	12		Because it was turned around, so I turned it around.
30	12	Oh, ok.	
30	12		The cat.
30	12	The cat? Ok. Do we have a guess where this piece should go yet?	
30	12		I think over here.
30	12	You think here like this?	
30	12	Does that work?	
30	12		No.
30	12	No? Should we save it still?	
30	12	How could we tell it doesn't work there?	
30	12		Because this is not black. This is green.
30	12	Oh ok. And why do we need black there.	
30	12		Because that's how it makes a cow.
30	12	Oh ok, what do you think we should do with this piece.	
30	12		I think think we should… um…
30	12		Put it over here.
30	12	Put it over here like this?	
30	12		No.
30	12	No? Oh ok how'd you fix it?	
30	12		I turned it around.
30	12	You turned it around? Ok.	
30	12		
30	12	And do we have a guess where this piece should go yet?	
30	12		Over here.
30	12	Over here like this?	
30	12	Why do you think it might go there?	
30	12	Oh, how do we know it has to go there?	
30	12		Because this is the corner.
30	12	That's the corner? Ok.	
30	12	And what made you try it here first?	
30	12	Why'd you think it could go there.	
30	12		The smiley face.
30	12	The smiley face? Ok.	
30	12	What do you think we should do with this piece?	
30	12		Put it over here.
30	12	Put it over here like this?	
30	12		No.
30	12	No? Oh, how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
30	12		Because you turned it around and put it over here.
30	12	Oh, ok. And what about this piece where do we think this one should go.	
30	12		We should put it over here.
30	12	Put it over here like this?	
30	12		No.
30	12	No? How'd you get that one to fit?	
30	12		You turned it around like this and I turned it around like that.
30	12	Ok. And our last piece, where should we put this one.	
30	12	Right here. How'd you know it had to go there?	
30	12		Because this part is green and this part is black and this part is yellow.
30	12	Ok. Great job.	
31	12	We're going to play a fun game with it. Can I show you how to play the game?	
31	12	Ok. So let's scoot over for this one.	
31	12	Ok. So for this one, I have the puzzle pieces stacked ok?	
31	12	And what we're going do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in, ok?	
31	12	Make sure to use your words cause I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok?	
31	12	Ok. And this is what the puzzle's going to look like when we're all done.	
31	12	Kay, you ready to start? Ok.	
31	12	So. This is our first piece, can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
31	12	It should go right here?	
31	12	How'd you know that? How'd you know it would go there?	
31	12	Huh? You don't know? How'd you figure it out?	
31	12	You knew right where to put that one.	
31	12	How'd you know?	
31	12	you don't know? Ok.	
31	12	What about this piece, where do you think we should put that one.	
31	12	In here like this?	
31	12	No? How do we know that's wrong?	
31	12	Oh, there we go. How'd you know those pieces would match?	
31	12		I don't know.
31	12	You don't know? Well what made you guess it might go there first?	
31	12	You don't know? Ok.	
31	12	What about this piece where do you think this one should go.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12		No.
31	12	No? How should I fix it?	
31	12		Turn it around.
31	12	Turn it around like this?	
31	12		No.
31	12	No? Then what should I do?	
31	12	Ok, how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
31	12		I don't know.
31	12	You don't know? How'd you know we had to turn it.	
31	12		That way.
31	12	Ok.	
31	12		That's where the horse is.
31	12	Cause that's where the horse is? Ok	
31	12		The horse legs.
31	12	Yeah, the horse's legs. Ok.	
31	12	What about this piece, should go here like this?	
31	12		No.
31	12	No? What should I do to fix it?	
31	12	Oh ok how could you tell we had to put it that way.	
31	12		Because I got to tell you to do that.
31	12	Hmm?	
31	12		I gotta tell you to do that.
31	12	Yeah. Ok. What about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	Ok, how'd you know it had to go there?	
31	12		Cause I know.
31	12	But how did you know?	
31	12		I don't know.
31	12	You don't know? But you had to know something.	
31	12	You figured it out right away. How'd you figure it out?	
31	12	Was there something about that piece that made you put it there?	
31	12	What was it?	
31	12		It was a pig.
31	12	It was a pig? So you think the pig should go there?	
31	12	Ok. What about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	No? What should I do to fix it?	
31	12		Turn it around.
31	12	Turn it around ok.	
31	12	There we go. And how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
31	12	How'd you know?	
31	12		I don't know.
31	12	You don't know?	
31	12	But you had to know something, you knew right what to do with it.	
31	12	You knew that right away, how'd you know?	
31	12	You don't know? Ok.	
31	12	Keeping it secret from me? You know how to put these pieces in? ok.	
31	12	What about this piece, where should we try this one.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	No? How do I fix it?	
31	12		Put it right there.
31	12	Oh you think it should go here instead?	
31	12	That look right? Ok. Why do you think it goes here.	
31	12		I wanna see the puzzle.
31	12	You wanna see the puzzle? Ok.	
31	12	Well we're gonna try to do it without it, ok?	
31	12	So what made you think it might go there first.	
31	12		Yeah better puzzle because we see the same thing.
31	12	What about this piece where do we think this one should go.	
31	12		That's a sheep
31	12	It's a sheep? Where should we put the sheep?	
31	12		I don't know.
31	12	You don't know? Do you have a guess?	
31	12	If it's not right, we can change it later.	
31	12	Make a guess?	
31	12	No? Ok. We can save it.	
31	12	What about this piece where do you think this one should go.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	No? How do I fix it?	
31	12		Turn it around.
31	12	Turn it around like that?	
31	12	Oh, ok. But there's something wrong, it's not fitting right there.	
31	12	Ok, how'd you know that piece had to go there.	
31	12		Because…
31	12	Because how?	
31	12		There's where it goes right there.
31	12	That's where it goes? Ok.	
31	12	So what about this piece we had that piece in the wrong spot where should we try that do you think?	
31	12	You don't know? Should we save this one for later too?	
31	12	Ok. What about this piece, where should we try this one.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	No? How should we fix it.	
31	12	Oh, what'd you do to make it fit?	
31	12	How'd you make it fit?	
31	12	How could you tell I put it in wrong.	
31	12		Cause you put it in wrong.
31	12	Yeah? Ok.  What about this piece where do you think we should try this one.	
31	12	Right here like this? No?	
31	12		It goes on the duck.
31	12	Goes on the duck? Ok, how could you tell it goes on the duck?	
31	12		Because.
31	12	Because how?	
31	12		Because it goes right there
31	12	Ok. So what about this piece do we know where we should try this one yet?	
31	12	No? Ok. What about this one.	
31	12	No, not yet? Ok.	
31	12	What about this piece.	
31	12	Right here like this?	
31	12	No, how do we fix it?	
31	12	Oh, ok how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
31	12	How'd you know?	
31	12	Oh, do you know where that one goes?	
31	12	Oh, what made you try it there?	
31	12		Because that's right where it goes.
31	12	That's where it goes? Ok.	
31	12	But how did you know that's where it goes.	
31	12	You knew right where to put that one, how'd you know?	
31	12		I know I put it in right.
31	12	Ok what about our last piece.	
31	12	There we go we got it.	
32	12	Ok. So the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna play a game with a different puzzle, ok?	
32	12		I know how to do this game.
32	12	You do?	
32	12		Because I have it.
32	12		But one of them has only the farm.
32	12	Oh yeah?	
32	12	Ok. So I'm going to be explaining how to do this game.	
32	12	So I have the puzzle pieces stacked, and what you're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in, ok?	
32	12		Ok.
32	12	And make sure you use your words, because I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do, ok?	
32	12		Ok.
32	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
32	12		Do you mind if I write, put down so I know which ones?
32	12	We're gonna cover this one up, though, we're gonna try to do it without this puzzle, okay?	
32	12	To make it a little harder.	
32	12		Yeah. But sometimes I used to put the puzzle pieces down on the, on the pile
32	12	Yeah? Ok. So this is our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
32	12		That one.
32	12	We should put it here? Ok.	
32	12	How'd you know it had to go there?	
32	12		Because I know because I have this puzzle at home.
32	12	Okay, so you have this one too?	
32	12		Uh-huh. But sometimes I don't play a game with it.
32	12	Right. Okay. So what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one?	
32	12		Um, save it.
32	12	Save it? Do you have a guess where it might go?	
32	12		No.
32	12	Let's make a guess.	
32	12	Can you make a guess?	
32	12	For now, if we're not right, we can change it later.	
32	12	Do you have a guess?	
32	12	no? Okay, we can save it then.	
32	12	What about this piece?	
32	12		Right there.
32	12	Right here? That look great?	
32	12		No.
32	12	No? Why doesn't that look great?	
32	12		Because we're missing a cow piece.
32	12	We're missing a cow piece? Ok.	
32	12	So should we save this one too?	
32	12		Uh-huh.
32	12	Ok.	
32	12		### that down
32	12	What about this piece?	
32	12		Um, right there.
32	12	There we go, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
32	12		Because I had a the tail.
32	12	Yeah, the tail? Ok.	
32	12	So what about this piece, do we have a guess where this one should go yet?	
32	12	Where? Can you use your words and tell me what you're doing?	
32	12		Right here.
32	12	Right here? Ok. How'd you know that piece would go there?	
32	12		Because I saw the body of it.
32	12	Oh, you saw the body of it.	
32	12	Okay, so can you tell me what to do with this piece?	
32	12	Do you know yet?	
32	12		Right here.
32	12	Right here like this?	No. Turn it like that.
32	12	Turn it like that. Ok.	
32	12	So how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
32	12		Because it was the farmhouse plus, like, this.
32	12	Oh, ok.	
32	12	So what about this piece?	
32	12	Do you know where this one should go?	
32	12		Um, no.
32	12	No? Do you want to make a guess?	
32	12	Where? Where do you think it might go?	
32	12		Um, right here.
32	12	Right here like this?	
32	12		No. It's like, here in the middle.
32	12		Like that.
32	12	There? Ok.	
32	12	Why do you think it goes there?	
32	12		Because I think, I think that piece would go there.
32	12	Ok. So what about this piece?	
32	12	Where should we put this one?	
32	12	Use your words and tell me?	
32	12		Right there.
32	12	Right here like this?	
32	12		Um, this way.
32	12	Oh, right there. Ok.	
32	12	How'd you know that piece would go there?	
32	12		Because.
32	12	Oh, look at that!	
32	12	How'd you know those pieces would match?	Because I thought that piece would go there.
32	12		But the pig was going up there.
32	12	Right. So what about this piece, where do you think this one should go.	
32	12		It would go, right there.
32	12	Right there like this?	
32	12		Maybe, right there.
32	12	Right there? Ok. Why do you think it goes there?	
32	12		Because I think because it has that.
32	12	Ok. Because it has what.	
32	12	What'd you point to.	
32	12		That way.
32	12	Oh, ok. So what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one.	
32	12		Um. Put it right there.
32	12	Put it right here?	
32	12	Okay, how'd you know it had to go there?	
32	12		Because I saw the horse's leg.
32	12	Horse's leg, okay.	
32	12		That's missing a horse's leg.
32	12	Yeah? Ok. What about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one?	
32	12	Can you use your words to tell me?	
32	12		Put it right there.
32	12	Right here like this?	
32	12		No.
32	12	No?	
32	12		Like… take that.
32	12	Oh, that. Ok.	
32	12	Ok, and why'd you move that piece?	
32	12		Because I thought that was going right there, I thought that piece was going right there.
32	12	Yeah? So why couldn't this piece stay here?	
32	12		Because I thought it was going right there but it couldn't fit.
32	12	Okay. Why can't it fit there?	
32	12		Because the cow's leg has to go back there.
32	12	Oh, the cow has to go back there? Ok.	
32	12	What about this piece?	
32	12	What'd you do with this one, can you use your words and tell me?	
32	12		Right there.
32	12	Right here like this?	
32	12		No, like that.
32	12	Oh ok, what'd you do to fix it?	
32	12		Because, the chickie has to go like that.
32	12	The chickie has to go like that? Ok.	
32	12	What about this piece?	
32	12	Can you use your words and tell me what you do with it?	
32	12		Right there.
32	12	Right here like this?	
32	12		No, like that.
32	12		So it can fit.
32	12	Oh, ok. How could you tell I put it in wrong?	
32	12		Because there was the duck was straight.
32	12	The duck was what?	
32	12		Straight.
32	12	Straight? Oh, ok.	
32	12	What about this piece?	
32	12		That's going to go right there.
32	12	Oh, so here like this?	
32	12		No.
32	12	No?	
32	12		Like this.
32	12	Oh, ok what'd you do to fix it?	
32	12		Because it was like, wrong.
32	12	It was wrong? Ok.	
32	12	How could you tell it was wrong?	
32	12		Because I, cause the duck has got to go straight up.
32	12	Oh, ok. Straight up like that?	
32	12		Uh-huh.
32	12	Okay, good job, we're all done.	
33	12	We're gonna play a game with my friend puzzle, ok.	
33	12	So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna do the puzzle but you're gonna tell me how.	
33	12	So I stack all the pieces of the puzzle and you're gonna tell me where they go and I'm gonna put them in.	
33	12	And I'm only gonna only do what you tell me to ok?	
33	12	So look at the puzzle.	
33	12		Good game. ###
33	12		Nope.
33	12		Ok ## at the right… different.
33	12		That's right. Oh yeah.
33	12	Ok you ready?	
33	12	So remember what I said is that I've stacked all the pieces and you're gonna tell me what to do with them ok?	
33	12	I'm only gonna do what you tell me so be sure to tell me, use your words ok?	
33	12	What do you-what should I do with this one?	
33	12		Mm, put it up in the sky.
33	12	Up in the sky? Like here?	
33	12	Yeah?	
33	12	Scoot it over, ok.	
33	12	What about this one? Where should I put it?	
33	12	Can you tell me with words?	
33	12		Right here the barn goes barn.
33	12	Ok.	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Now where should this one go.	
33	12		Oh that's where the horsey goes.
33	12	So where should I put it?	
33	12		I think by the horsey.
33	12	Where by the horsey?	
33	12		Look at that. Right there.
33	12	You want me to try right there?	
33	12	Like that?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Ok. How about this, where should this go?	
33	12		I think… the horsey goes there… ##
33	12		Wait a second back there?
33	12	Try it back there?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12		Ah, there.
33	12	Like that?	
33	12		Yes that's it.
33	12	Where does this one go?	
33	12		That's so… I see the piggy. Where's the pig?
33	12		Where is that piggy?
33	12		Oh, wait a second.
33	12	Where should I put this piece?	
33	12	See it?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Where do you think I should try it?	
33	12	I can try it anywhere, where do you want me to try it?	
33	12		I'm thinking here.
33	12	Here?	
33	12		Here.
33	12	Like that?	
33	12		No.
33	12	No? How?	
33	12	Tell me with your words, remember I'm working with the puzzle and you're telling me.	
33	12	Try it here?	
33	12		Turn.
33	12	Turn? Ok like this?	
33	12		The other way.
33	12	Like this?	
33	12		No.
33	12	No, hmm.	
33	12	Do you have another idea?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Where's your other idea where I can put the piggy?	
33	12	It didn't fit there, remember?	
33	12		Yeah I remember.
33	12	Do you want me to try to just put it there for now?	
33	12	We can fix it later, ok?	
33	12	How about this, where should this go?	
33	12		Oh, wait a pig?
33	12		Oh, look at that pig.
33	12		Do you think it should go by the pig?
33	12	By the pig?	
33	12		I don't know.
33	12	Like that?	
33	12		No.
33	12		Wait a second.
33	12	What?	
33	12		That's a part of a horsey.
33	12	Ok so where should I put it then?	
33	12		I think there.
33	12	You think here?	
33	12		Yeah right there.
33	12	There we go.	
33	12		There we go.
33	12	Ok where should this one go then.	
33	12		I think right the pig there?
33	12	Right there?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Ok. Now. What about this one, where do you think this one goes.	
33	12		Oh, down here.

33	12		Because it was there.
33	12	Because it was there, ok.	
33	12	What about this one, where should this one go?	
33	12		Oh, by the cow.
33	12	By the cow? Where by the cow?	
33	12		Up there?
33	12	Here?

33	12		Right, uh, like right there.
33	12	Like right here?	
33	12		We can fix it later.
33	12	Fix it later? Ok.	
33	12	Where do you think this guy goes.	
33	12		Oh, that's something like where that cow goes.
33	12	Oh, really?	
33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Ok.

33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Like that?	
33	12		Oh.

33	12		Yeah.
33	12	Oh, wow ok.	
33	12	Then let's try to fix this one, where does this one go now.

35	12	Ok so this is our first piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
35	12	Where do you think it should go.	
35	12	Should go here like this?	
35	12		Yeah.
35	12	Yeah ok why do you think it goes there?	
35	12		Think it can be here.
35	12	What?	
35	12		Think it should stay here.
35	12	You think it should stay right here?	
35	12		Yes. We can put something there.

35	12	And what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
35	12	What do you think we should do with it.	
35	12		Was it from…
35	12	Hm?	
35	12		Where does it go.
35	12	I don't know, where do you think it should go.	
35	12	Go there?	
35	12	There we go, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
35	12	Huh?	
35	12	How'd you know that?	
35	12	How'd you figure it out?	
35	12		Put it in.
35	12	Put it in? ok.	
35	12	And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
35	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
35	12		Yeah.
35	12	Yeah? Where do you think we should try it.	
35	12	Right here like this?	
35	12	That look right?	
35	12	Does it look like it matches there?	
35	12	Oh, we should try it that way?	
35	12	That look like it matches?	
35	12		Yeah.
35	12	Yeah? Ok you think it should stay there?	
35	12	Ok why do you think that.	
35	12	Hm?	
35	12	Ok, should we do our next piece?	
35	12	So what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
35	12	Can I take a turn and put one in?	
35	12	Ok. So where do you think I should put this one.	
35	12	Oh, right here?	
35	12	You got it! How'd you know those pieces would match?	
35	12	Huh? How'd you know that?	
35	12	How'd you figure it out?	
35	12	Hm? You knew right where to put that piece.	
35	12	How'd you know?	
35	12	Ok. So does this piece still look good here?	
35	12	Well let's see what about if we do this.	
35	12	does that look right? Ok.	
35	12	And I'm gonna move these pieces here.	
35	12	Ok. So what about this piece, what should we do with this one.	
35	12	It should go here?	
35	12	That look right?	
35	12		Yeah.
35	12	Yeah?	
35	12		Goes there.
35	12	Ok why do you think it goes there.	
35	12		Because it goes behind the horsey.
35	12	Goes behind the horsey? Ok.	
35	12	Uh, so what about this piece, where do you think this one should go?	
35	12	Oh, so it should go here?	
35	12	But we've already got a piece here, what should we do with this piece then.	
35	12	Ok you think it should go like this?	
35	12	That look right?	
35	12	So what do you think we should do.	
35	12	Well what about if we move this piece.	
35	12	Now where do you think we should try this one	
35	12	There we go how could you tell that piece would go there?	
35	12	How'd you know that?	
35	12		Like a face.
35	12	It's a face? Ok.	
35	12	And what about this piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
35	12	Do you have a guess where this one should go?	
35	12	Where do you think it should go.	
35	12	Do you know yet?	
35	12	Where do you think it should go?	
35	12	If you're not sure we can come back to it, we can save it for later.	
35	12	Think it should go here like this?	
35	12	That look right there?	
35	12	Do you have another guess? Or should we save it for later?	
35	12		Need help.
35	12	Ok we'll save this one, ok, we'll come back to it.	
35	12	So what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
35	12	Where do you think it should go?	
35	12		I don't know.
35	12	You don't know? Should we save this one too?	
35	12	So what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
35	12		I don't know.
35	12	You don't know? Ok we'll save that one too.	
35	12	What about this piece, where should we try this one?	
35	12		I don't know.
35	12	You don't know? Ok.	
35	12	What about this piece.	
35	12	There we go you knew right where to put that one how'd you figure it out?	
35	12	How'd you know where	
35	12		Something had the toes in the water.
35	12	Oh ok. So what about any of these pieces are we ready for these yet?	
35	12	What about this one?	
35	12	You have a guess where this one should go?	
35	12	You're not ready for it yet?	
35	12	There we go, how'd you know where to put that one?	
35	12		By the pig.
35	12	By the pig? Ok.	
35	12	What about this piece, can I take a turn, can you tell me where we should put this one?	
35	12	Where do you think it should go?	
35	12	Right here like this?	
35	12	does that look right?	
35	12	Hm. Where else could that piece go.	
35	12	There we go what made you try it there?	
35	12	Huh?	
35	12		Behind the baby duck.
35	12	Behind the baby duck? Ok.	
35	12	What about this piece, do we know where this one should go yet?	
35	12	You think it should go here?	
35	12	Like that? Hm.	
35	12	Where else could we try that piece?	
35	12	How'd you know it would go there?	
35	12	Huh? How'd you figure that out?	
35	12		It fits better.
35	12	How do we know it fits better?	
35	12		Because the cat's goes, because it goes there behind the cat.
35	12	Behind the cat? Ok and how could you tell it didn't fit there?	
35	12	You were trying it there, how could you tell it wouldn't fit there?	
35	12		I wanna do this one.
35	12	You wanna do that one? Ok where do you think that one should go.	
35	12	Great job, how'd you know that piece would go there?	
35	12	Hm? How'd you figure that out?	
35	12		So can see the chicken.
35	12	So you can see the chicken?	
35	12	Ok so it's the last piece, can I take a turn and try to put it in?	
35	12		Right there.
35	12	Right here like this?	
35	12	Oh, like that.	
35	12	Ok how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
35	12	Huh?	
35	12		So you can see the cow.
35	12	So you can see the cow?	
35	12	Ok and how could we, how could you tell we couldn't see the cow the way I put it in?	
35	12	Hm?	
35	12		So it can be better.
35	12	Ok good job.	
36	12	So this next puzzle is a puzzle with farm animals.	
36	12	So I've stacked all the pieces of the puzzle and when it's all done, it's gonna look just like this. Ok?	
36	12	So you're gonna have to tell me where the pieces go, where I should put them in.	
36	12	So I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do	
36	12		But this is the story.
36	12		It's double…
36	12	Ok. So where do you think I should put this piece.	
36	12		Right here.
36	12	Right here? You think the piece should go right there?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Ok. So what do you think I should do with this piece.	
36	12	Right there, you think it should go right there?	
36	12	Here? Ok.	
36	12	Now what do you think I should do where should I put this piece.	
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	Does this work? No?	
36	12	All right, where do you think it should go.	
36	12	Right there? Like this?	
36	12	Should I fix it?	
36	12	How should I fix it?	
36	12	So where do you think it should go.	
36	12		Uh.
36	12	###, where do you think this one should go.	
36	12	Right here? Like this?	
36	12	Or do I need to fix it.	
36	12		Fix it.
36	12	Fix it? How should I fix it?	
36	12		Put it in right there.
36	12	Put it in right there? How, how should I put it in.	
36	12		Just put it in.
36	12	Put it in? Oh.	
36	12	But does this work?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	I don't think it works. So where should this piece go.	
36	12		There.
36	12	There? I don't think it works there.	
36	12		Yes it does.
36	12	It does? Ok.	
36	12	How about here? I think it works there, ok?	
36	12	Alright. How about this one, where should this piece go.	
36	12		Go right here.
36	12	Right there? Like this?	
36	12	Ok.	
36	12	Now where should this piece go.	
36	12		Here.
36	12	Here? Like this?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Ok. Does that work?	
36	12		No.
36	12	No? What should I, how should I fix it.	
36	12	There? Does that work?	
36	12	I think it goes somewhere else. Where do you think it should go.	
36	12	There? Ok.	
36	12	Let's try another one.	
36	12	Where do you think this piece should go.	
36	12	Tell me where you think it should go.	
36	12	Right here?	
36	12	You think it should go right there?	
36	12	Does that work?	
36	12	No, so where do you think it should go.	
36	12	Right here? Does this work?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	I don't think it goes there.	
36	12	So where do you think this one goes.	
36	12		Don't know.
36	12	You don't know?	
36	12		No.
36	12	Should we try, how about there, or right there?	
36	12	Where do you think it goes.	
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	Does this work?	
36	12	How should I…	
36	12	Ok. So where do you think this one goes.	
36	12		Um, right here.
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	Like this? Yeah?	
36	12	Does that work?	
36	12		No.
36	12	Ok. So then where do you think it goes.	
36	12		Right there.
36	12	Right there? But it doesn't work there.	
36	12	So where do you, where else could it go.	
36	12	Right here? Like this?	
36	12	Or should I fix it.	
36	12	Like that? Ok.	
36	12	How about this one, where do you think this one goes.	
36	12		Right here.
36	12	Right there? Uh-oh.	
36	12	I don't think that works. Should I fix it?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	How should I fix it.	
36	12		I don't know.
36	12	You don't know? Alright.	
36	12	How about this one, where do you think this one should go.	
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	What do I need to do to fix it.	
36	12	Ok. Moving on.	
36	12	How about this one, where do you think this one should go.	
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	Think it should go there?	
36	12	Does that work there?	
36	12	Should I fix that?	
36	12	Tell me where it should go.	
36	12	Ok. How about this one. Where do you think this one should go.	
36	12	Right there? Ok.	
36	12	Now how about this one, where do you think this one should go.	
36	12		I don't know.
36	12	You don't know? Do you wanna try a different one?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Ok. How about this one, where do you think this one should go.	
36	12	Right there? Ok. Like this?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Does it work like this?	
36	12		Yes.
36	12	I don't think it fits like that.	
36	12	How should I fix it?	
36	12		I don't know.
36	12	What if I go like, what if I go like this.	
36	12	Does that work?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Ok.	
36	12	So where do you think this one goes.	
36	12		Right here.
36	12	Right here? Like that?	
36	12		Yeah.
36	12	Does that work?	
36	12	What do we need to do.	
36	12	Ok. One more, where do you think this one goes.	
36	12		I don't know.
36	12	Well, where's left?	
36	12	Where do you think it could go.	
36	12	Ok, ###. We're all done.	
37	12	So this one we're gonna do a little differently, we're gonna play a game with it ok?	
37	12	So what we're gonna do is I have the puzzle pieces stacked and you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in, ok?	
37	12		Ok.
37	12	But make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do, ok?	
37	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look when we're all done	
37	12	Ok you ready to start?	
37	12		Um, not yet.
37	12	Not yet? You wanna take another look at this?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Yeah? Ok.	
37	12	So take a good look. Now are you ready to start?	
37	12		Think yeah.
37	12	Yeah? Cool.	
37	12	Ok, so this is our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
37	12	It should go here like this?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Like that?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Yeah? Ok. Why do you think it goes there?	
37	12		It does.
37	12	It does but how can you tell?	
37	12		It does.
37	12	It does? Ok.	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	What about this piece?	
37	12	Where does this one go?	
37	12		It goes… 
37	12	Oh, ok like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Ok how'd you know those pieces would match?	
37	12		It does cause they
37	12	It does, yeah but how can you tell how'd you know that right away?	
37	12		It does.
37	12	It does?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	But how can you tell?	
37	12	Oh, and why'd you move those pieces there?	
37	12		Because it does go there.
37	12	It does go there?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	And how can you tell it goes there?	
37	12		Hee, hee, hee.
37	12	Is there something about these pieces that makes you think they go there?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	What is it?	
37	12		I think they go there.
37	12	Oh ok. What about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Like this?	
37	12		Here like this.
37	12	Oh, like that.	
37	12	Ok so I put it in wrong. How could you tell?	
37	12		It does go there.
37	12	Ok, and how'd you fix it, how'd you make it fit.	
37	12		It's in that big squeeze.
37	12	It's a tight squeeze?	
37	12		It is a easy, it is easy…
37	12	Yeah, ok what about this piece where should we put it	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here? How'd you know it would go there?	
37	12		It's not a tight fit.
37	12	It's not a tight fit so we know it goes there?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Ok. What about this piece. Where should we try this one	
37	12		Go right there.
37	12	Right here?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Does that look right?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Ok why do you think it goes there.	
37	12		It goes right here.
37	12	Right there? Ok.	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Why do you think it goes there?	
37	12		Piggy.
37	12	Cause the pig?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	You think that's where the pig goes?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Ok. Oh, which way do you think that piece goes.	
37	12		Um, let's do the next
37	12	Do another one?	
37	12		uh, the next pieces
37	12	So do we know where this one should go yet?	
37	12		No.
37	12	No, ok. We'll wait for that piece.	
37	12	What about this piece, where should we try this one.	
37	12	Goes there? How'd you know that piece would go there?	
37	12		It's not a tight fit, ok?
37	12	It's not a tight fit? Ok.	
37	12	Now what about this piece can you tell me where I should	
37	12		It go right there.
37	12	Goes right here like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12		No.
37	12	No?	
37	12		It goes right here.
37	12	Right there?	
37	12		You have to wait for it.
37	12	We do?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Are you sure?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Ok.	
37	12	What about this piece.	
37	12	Can I use, can I try to do it? Can you use your words and tell me where to put it now?	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		No.
37	12	No? How do we fix it?	
37	12		Um, what's that black?
37	12	What's the black?	
37	12		What?
37	12	I don't know. What do you think we should do with this piece.	
37	12		Oh maybe it's something.
37	12	Yeah?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Do you know where we should put this piece yet?	
37	12		Um, no.
37	12	No? Ok we can wait for this piece too.	
37	12	What about this one?	
37	12	Can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		No, that's not right.
37	12	No? How do we fix it?	
37	12		I don't know.
37	12	You don't know?	
37	12		It goes right…
37	12	I think you're right, I think this piece goes here, but we have to do something to it to make it fit.	
37	12	What should we try to do?	
37	12		Kitty cat piece has to go here.
37	12	Oh ok so what should I do with this piece then?	
37	12		I don't think we're ready for it yet.
37	12	We're not ready? Are you sure?	
37	12	What about here.	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Yeah, that fits. Good job.	
37	12	What made you think that piece could go there.	
37	12		Cause it's not a tight fit.
37	12	It's not a tight fit? Ok.	
37	12		No.
37	12	So what about these two pieces, are we ready for either of these yet?	
37	12		Maybe.
37	12	Maybe? Which one?	
37	12	This one?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Yeah? What do you think we should do with it?	
37	12		Um…
37	12	There we go, how'd you know that piece would go there?	
37	12		Cause it's not a tight fit.
37	12	It's not a tight fit. Is there something about that piece that made you think it might go there?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	What was it?	
37	12		I don't know.
37	12	You don't know? Ok.	
37	12	What about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
37	12		Um, it goes right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		Yeah, it goes right to there.
37	12	Right to here like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12	Oh ok how'd you know I put it in wrong?	
37	12		Because it's not
37	12	How could you tell?	
37	12		It's not wrong.
37	12	It's what?	
37	12		It is right.
37	12	It's right?	
37	12		Because there's there.
37	12	Yeah. Ok what about this piece.	
37	12	Can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		Yes.
37	12		It goes like that.
37	12	Like that? Ok so what should I do to this piece then.	
37	12		Um it goes like up.
37	12	It goes like up like this?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Ok how'd you know it had to do that?	
37	12		It's not a tight squeeze.
37	12	Not a tight squeeze? Ok.	
37	12	So what about this piece, do you have any idea where this one could go yet?	
37	12	Right here?	
37	12		It goes right there.
37	12	Oh right there like this?	
37	12		Here. No.
37	12	No? How do we fix it?	
37	12		It goes like this.
37	12	Like what? Can you tell me?	
37	12		Um, like this.
37	12	Oh, like this?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Ok how'd you know it had to go like that.	
37	12		That is because it goes there.
37	12	Because it goes there?	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	Ok what about this piece.	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	Right here like this?	
37	12		no.
37	12	No? How do we fix it?	
37	12		It goes like this.
37	12	Like what?	
37	12		Um, see how it goes this.
37	12	Oh, like this.	
37	12		Yeah.
37	12	ok, how'd you know it had to go like that.	
37	12	How could you tell?	
37	12		Cause it's not a tight squeeze.
37	12	Not a tight squeeze? Ok.	
37	12	What about our last piece.	
37	12		Right there.
37	12	right here, how'd you know it had to go here?	
37	12		It's not a tight squeeze.
37	12	Ok guess what we're all done in here.	
38	12	We're gonna do this one a little differently, ok, we're gonna play a game with it	
38	12	Ok? So can you have a seat in your chair and I'll explain how to play the game?	
38	12		Yes.
38	12	Ok. So for this puzzle I have the puzzle pieces stacked, ok?	
38	12	What we're gonna do is you're going to tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok?	
38	12	But make sure to use your words because I'm only going to do what you tell me to do, ok?	
38	12		Yes.
38	12	Ok.	
38	12		I wanna do this one.
38	12	It's the same one, I just have the pieces stacked.	
38	12	So this is what it's going to look like when we're all done. Ok.	
38	12	Ok, you ready to start?	
38	12		I don't think so but I don't think I can tell the pieces.
38	12	What?	
38	12		I don't think I can tell the pieces from the ###.
38	12	Well just try your best ok?	
38	12	Ok.	
38	12		How about you tell me where the pieces where to go.
38	12	Ok well do you have a guess where this first piece could go?	
38	12		I think it goes here.
38	12	I think you're right, how'd you figure that out?	
38	12	How'd you know that?	
38	12		Because I put my thinking cap on.
38	12	You put your thinking cap on? Ok.	
38	12	Was there something about that piece that told you it might go there?	
38	12	What was it?	
38	12		The roof.
38	12	The roof?	
38	12		The roof is right here.
38	12	The roof's right there? Ok.	
38	12	And why would the roof go right there?	
38	12		Because it's on top of the house.
38	12	It's on top? Ok.	
38	12	So what about this piece, do you have an idea where this one could go?	
38	12		Uh…
38	12	Right here like this?	
38	12		No, like this.
38	12		Like this.
38	12	Oh, ok. How'd you know those pieces would match?	
38	12		Because it's red right here and red right there.
38	12	Ok and how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
38	12	Hm? I put it in wrong, how could you tell?	
38	12		Because it was like this.
38	12	Ok and why is that wrong?	
38	12		Because you couldn't like this upside--put it this way.
38	12	Ok. Good. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
38	12		Down here.
38	12	Down here like this?	
38	12		No like this.
38	12	Ok. How'd you fix it?	
38	12		Because it's brown here and brown here and black here.
38	12	Oh ok and what'd you do to make it fit?	
38	12		Turn like this.
38	12	Turn it like that? Ok.	
38	12	What about this piece where do you think we should try this piece?	
38	12		Uh, I think here.
38	12	Think here like this?	
38	12		No. Think like…
38	12		I think.
38	12	Oh, right there? Ok.	
38	12	How could you tell it would go there?	
38	12		Because it's black on its tail.
38	12	Black on its tail? Ok.	
38	12	And what made you guess here first?	
38	12	What made you guess it might go there?	
38	12		Because it's red here and it's brown here.
38	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one	
38	12		I don't see pink.
38	12	You don't see pink?	
38	12		I think it'll go here.
38	12	Go there? Ok, how'd you know that?	
38	12		Because it's on top.
38	12	It's on top? How can you tell it's on top?	
38	12		Because it's on top of the corn.
38	12	It's on top of the corn? Ok.	
38	12	What about this piece, where should we try this one.	
38	12		Just here.
38	12	Right there? Ok.	
38	12	How'd you know those pieces would match?	
38	12		Because it's brown here and green here.
38	12	And green there? Ok.	
38	12	What about this piece where should we try this one?	
38	12		Uh… here.
38	12	Here like this?	
38	12		No.
38	12	Where should we try it.	
38	12		Uh, here.
38	12	There?	
38	12		I think.
38	12	Does it go there?	
38	12		Maybe let's try here.
38	12	There? Ok. How'd you know it'd go there?	
38	12		Because the cow is on the bottom of the grass.
38	12	Ok and what made you think it might go there?	
38	12	What made you try it there first?	
38	12		Because it wasn't the bottom of the grass because there's no grass down here.
38	12	There's no grass there? Ok.	
38	12	What about this piece where should we try this one?	
38	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
38	12		Here I think.
38	12	You think here like this?	
38	12		No.
38	12	No?	
38	12		This, I think.
38	12	Like that? Does it match there?	
38	12		No.
38	12	No? How could we tell it doesn't match there?	
38	12		Because it's not black here.
38	12	Ok. So do you have another guess where this piece could go?	
38	12	Where do you think it could go?	
38	12		Here.
38	12	There? Ok, what made you think it would fit there.	
38	12		Because the cat is here and the cat is right here.
38	12	Oh ok. What about this piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
38	12		Here.
38	12	Here like this?	
38	12		No.
38	12	No? How do we fix it?	
38	12		Like this.
38	12	Like that?	
38	12		Um, like… maybe this could go…
38	12	Oh, I think that's right. Let's leave that one there.	
38	12	Where do you think this piece should go?	
38	12		Here.
38	12	Goes there?	
38	12		Turn it like this.
38	12	Turn it like that? Hmm.	
38	12	Does it match there?	
38	12		No, the piggy is right here though, maybe it belongs… here.
38	12	There we go, what made you try that piece there?	
38	12		Uh, because it's brown here and brown here.
38	12	Ok. And what about this piece can you use your words and tell me what I should do with it?	
38	12		Here.
38	12	I should put it here like this?	
38	12		No, like this.
38	12	Oh, ok what'd you to do fix that piece?	
38	12		Because it's white here and black here.
38	12	Black there, ok and how could you tell I put it in wrong.	
38	12		Because it was like this.
38	12	That, and why's that wrong?	
38	12		Because it's… because it's… upside down.
38	12	It's upside down, ok.	
38	12	Put it like that.	
38	12	Ok and what about	
38	12		We've only got 2 more pieces left.
38	12	Right, we're almost done. What about this piece?	
38	12		Uh, here.
38	12	Here like this?	
38	12		No, like this, I think.
38	12	That, ok, what'd you do to fix it?	
38	12		Because it's white here and white here and blue here.
38	12	Blue there, ok.	
38	12	And what about this piece?	
38	12		Right here.
38	12	Right there? How'd you know that piece had to go there?	
38	12		Because this all of this chicken is this yellow and the cow has black and white.
38	12	Ok, good job.	
39	12	So this one we're gonna do a little differently, we're gonna play a game with it ok?	
39	12	What we're gonna do is I have the puzzle pieces stacked and you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok?	
39	12	But make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do, ok?	
39	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
39	12	Ok, you ready to start?	
39	12	So this is our first piece can you tell me what I should do with it?	
39	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
39	12		Right here.
39	12	Right here like this?	
39	12	Ok why do you think it goes there?	
39	12		Because it's supposed to be up.
39	12	It's supposed to be up? Ok.	
39	12	And how could you tell it's supposed to be up?	
39	12		Because this is a farmhouse.
39	12	Oh, ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
39	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
39	12		It goes over here.
39	12	It goes here like this?	
39	12		No, like this.
39	12	Oh, like that.	
39	12	Ok how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
39	12		Because the horse is supposed to be this way.
39	12	Oh, ok. Oh, why'd you move those pieces?	
39	12		Because there's no more spots.
39	12	There's no more spots for it?	
39	12		There's no more space.
39	12	Yeah? Ok and how could you tell we had to move it here?	
39	12		Because there's no more space in the line.
39	12	Oh, ok. But why didn't you move it this way?	
39	12	Why can't it go right there?	
39	12		Because the horse can't be this way because there's no more space.
39	12	Oh, ok. Got it. So we'll leave it there.	
39	12	So what about this piece can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
39	12		It goes over here.
39	12	Goes here? Like that?	
39	12		No, like this.
39	12	That?	
39	12	Oh, it goes there? How'd you know it would go there?	
39	12		Because the feet goes right here and the head goes right here.
39	12	Oh ok got it.	
39	12	And what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one.	
39	12		Right here.
39	12	Right here like this?	
39	12		No. Like… like…
39	12	Oh, it goes there?	
39	12	Ok, how'd you know it would go there?	
39	12		Because the tail goes right here, the head goes right here and the feet go right here and the stomach goes down here and the back goes up here.
39	12	oh, ok and what made you try it here first.	
39	12	What made you guess that it might go there.	
39	12		Because the head is supposed to be there.
39	12	Oh ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one?	
39	12		Um… I…
39	12	Should we make a guess? Where do you think it could go?	
39	12		It can go over here.
39	12	Right here like this?	
39	12		No, like…
39	12	Oh, that?	
39	12		We gotta do the pig first.
39	12	Oh ok so we should wait for this piece? Ok.	
39	12	And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
39	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
39	12		It goes over here.
39	12	Goes here like this?	
39	12		No, like…
39	12		Like…
39	12	Oh, it goes there? Ok.	
39	12	How could you tell that piece, ohh.	
39	12	There you go, how'd you know those pieces had to go like that.	
39	12		Because the corns are over here with the pig.
39	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
39	12		Um… over here?
39	12	Right here like this?	
39	12		No, like… over…
39	12		We didn't do that one yet.
39	12	Ok we'll wait for that one too?	
39	12	What made you think it might go here?	
39	12	Was that where we tried it?	
39	12	No, how could we tell tell it doesn't fit?	
39	12		Because the cat's supposed to be here and the duck's supposed to be here.
39	12	Oh ok. What about this piece, where do you think we should try this piece.	
39	12		Um, right there?
39	12	Right here like this?	
39	12	Ok.	
39	12	You think those pieces go together?	
39	12	Do you know what we should do with those yet?	
39	12		This doesn't fit on the sheep.
39	12	That doesn't fit on the sheep? Should we wait for this piece too?	
39	12	Should we try this piece later too?	
39	12	We can come back to that one.	
39	12	Put it over here?	
39	12		Yes.
39	12	Ok. What about this piece what do you thik we should do with this one.	
39	12		Put it right here.
39	12	Put it right here like this?	
39	12		No, like this.
39	12	Oh, ok. How'd you know that piece would go there?	
39	12		Because this go right here and the horse goes over here.
39	12	Ok. Do you know what we should do with that one now?	
39	12	Think it goes there?	
39	12		No.
39	12	No? why not?	
39	12		Because it's not supposed to be there.
39	12	Oh, ok.	
39	12	Ok,  should we try the next one?	
39	12	Or do you know where that one goes now.	
39	12	Oh, how'd you know that piece would go there?	
39	12		Because the cat goes right here and the sheep goes right here.
39	12	Ok. What about this piece, do you know what we should do with this one?	
39	12		Yes.

39	12	Goes here like this?	
39	12		No, like this.
39	12	Ok, how'd you fix it?	
39	12		Because it was white.
39	12	And how'd you know that piece would go there?	
39	12		Because, um, the cow go right here.
39	12	Mm-hm, but how could you tell the cow would go there?	
39	12		Because, because the horse go right here, the chicken goes right here, and the pig goes right here and the cat goes right here and the sheep goes right here
39	12	Ok, what about this piece?	
39	12		and the horse goes right here.
39	12	Where should we try this one?	
39	12	Ok and what about our last piece?	
39	12	Way to go.	
40	12	So we're gonna do this one a little differently ok we're gonna play a game with it.	
40	12	So what I did is I stacked all the pieces and what we're gonna do is you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in, ok?	
40	12	But make sure to use your words cause I'm only gonna do what you tell me to do, ok?	
40	12	And this is what the puzzle's gonna look like when we're all done.	
40	12		This is what I have from school.
40	12	You have this at school?	
40	12		Yeah
40	12	Oh ok.	
40	12		It looks like this.
40	12	Yeah?	
40	12		Yeah it's like the same
40	12	Oh, but I have the puzzle pieces here, we don't need to take this one apart. Ok?	
40	12		Ok.
40	12	You ready to start?	
40	12		Yeah.
40	12	Ok. Cool. So.	
40	12	This is our first piece, can you tell me what I should do with it?	
40	12	It should go here?	
40	12		Yes.
40	12	Ok, how'd you know it would go there?	
40	12		Because, because it has a side.
40	12	It has a side?	
40	12		Yeah.
40	12	Ok. And what about this piece, what do you think we should do with this one.	
40	12	Should go here like this?	
40	12		No!
40	12	No?	
40	12		It goes…
40	12	It goes like that?	
40	12	Oh ok so how could you tell I put it in wrong?	
40	12		So you have to put these together so these sides makes a part of it and this side makes the farm.
40	12	Ok. Got it.	
40	12	What about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	Right here like this?	
40	12		No that's a duck.
40	12	Oh, ok.	
40	12	Ok, how'd you fix it?	
40	12		I turned it around because it, this body was right over here but the ducky has like way over here so I, so a part of it's the ducky.
40	12	Ok. Cool, and what about this piece where do you think this one should go.	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	Right here like this?	
40	12		No, this is the kitten.
40	12	Oh, ok. How could you tell I put it in wrong?	
40	12		It's the kitten when it has a part and then it has this side to do it this way.
40	12	Oh, ok. And what'd you do to fix it?	
40	12	How'd you make it fit?	
40	12		You had to, you had to make, you had to find a picture so then you put it right.
40	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
40	12		Aww, piggy.
40	12	Where do you think the piggy goes.	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	Right here like this?	
40	12		No.
40	12	No? how do we fix it?	
40	12		See, it has a part of it.
40	12	Oh, so what do we do.	
40	12		Turn it around.
40	12	Ok. And how could you tell we had to turn it around.	
40	12		It's because this side has nothing.
40	12	Ok, got it.	
40	12	And what about this piece, what should we do with that one.	
40	12	Ok, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
40	12		Because this, this is a horsey head and this was a piggy head.
40	12	Ok. And what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where I should put it?	
40	12		Right down here.
40	12	Right down here like this?	
40	12		No!
40	12	No? how do we fix it?	
40	12		You have to turn it around.
40	12	Turn it around like this?	
40	12		no.
40	12	What should I do now?	
40	12		Turn it around again.
40	12	Again, like this?	
40	12		No.
40	12	No?	
40	12		Turn it around again.
40	12	Again, like this?	
40	12		Yes.
40	12	Ok, how'd you know it had to go like that?	
40	12		Because this is a sides.
40	12	It's a sides? Ok.	
40	12	And how could you tell that it's the sides?	
40	12		Because I know where they go fit.
40	12	Ok, and what about this piece, where should we try this one.	
40	12		Um, I don't know.
40	12	You don't know?	
40	12		Yeah.
40	12	Do you have a guess where it could go?	
40	12		I don't know because there's, there's no pieces.
40	12	No?	
40	12		With this…
40	12	oops.	
40	12		no I know. I guess it goes here.
40	12	Oh, you think it goes there?	
40	12	Why'd you think it might go there?	
40	12		Because it's a sheep.
40	12	It's a sheep? Ok.	
40	12		Yeah.
40	12	And why'd the sheep have to go there.	
40	12		Because it knows where it's going.
40	12	Ok, and what about this piece, where should we try this one.	
40	12		A piggy head.
40	12	Where should that go.	
40	12	Ok, how'd you know those pieces would match?	
40	12		Because it has like a cow head and a piggy head and a horse's head.
40	12	Ok. And what about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
40	12	Can you use your words and tell me?	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	Right here like this?	
40	12		No.
40	12	No? how do we fix it?	
40	12		Turn it around.
40	12	Turn it around like this?	
40	12		Yes.
40	12	Oh ok, how'd you know we had to do that?	
40	12		Because there's a chicken head in it and this head and this head and this head.
40	12	Ok and what about this piece, can you use your words and tell me what to do with it?	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	Right here like this?	
40	12		No.
40	12	No? How do I fix it?	
40	12		Turn it around.
40	12	Turn it around like this?	
40	12		No.
40	12	No? what should I do	
40	12		Turn it around again.
40	12	Again?	
40	12	How'd you know we had to turn it around.	
40	12		That's because it goes here.
40	12	Ok. And our last piece. Where's that one go.	
40	12	Goes…	
40	12		Right here.
40	12	There? There we go.	
40	12	How'd you know that piece had to go there.	
40	12		Because that's why it goes there.
40	12	Ok, good job.	
41	12	Ok so we're gonna play a game with this puzzle.	
41	12		What's in that treasure chest?
41	12	We'll have to wait and find out when we're all done, ok?	
41	12	Ok so we're gonna play	
41	12		Are we almost finished?
41	12	Not quite, we have a few more things to do, ok?	
41	12		We already finished this one.
41	12	We haven't done this one yet, can I explain how we're gonna do it?	
41	12		We got two more
41	12	Mhm.	
41	12		Two more.
41	12	Yeah, ok.	
41	12		Two more and then we're done.
41	12	Yeah. So what we're gonna do with this puzzle is I have the puzzle pieces stacked, and you're gonna tell me where to put the pieces and I'm gonna put them in ok.	
41	12	But make sure to use your words cause	
41	12		May I, may I tell you what kind of pieces are really um a little bit hard for me.
41	12	Ok.	
41	12		Can we do, hm, can we do this one first.
41	12	Well they're the same puzzle, I just have the pieces out so we're just gonna look at this as an example.	
41	12	So this is what it's gonna look like when it's all done.	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12	Ok? So you ready to start?	
41	12	Ok so I have all the pieces here.	
41	12	Ok so this is our first piece, can you tell me where I should put it?	
41	12		Um, a barn.
41	12	So where do you think it should go?	
41	12		buh, buh, B!
41	12	Yeah? Where do you think we should try this piece?	
41	12		You should be um you should be um like the other one puzzle.
41	12	Yeah? Ok but we're not gonna look at that one we're gonna try to do it without looking ok?	
41	12	Do you have a guess where that one should go?	
41	12		I think it should be right here.
41	12	Right there? Ok. Why do you think it should go right there?	
41	12		Because the barn is with the grass and the animals don't want to get, don't want to run.
41	12	Ok.	
41	12		They want, they don't
41	12	What about this piece, where do you think we should try this one.	
41	12		It should be with the other body with the pony and the animals.
41	12	Ok so where do you think it should go in this puzzle.	
41	12		It should go um, it should go right here.
41	12	Right here like this?	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12	Ok why do you think it goes there?	
41	12		The face.
41	12	Mhm.	
41	12		And the hair.
41	12	Ok.	
41	12		And the barn is right there
41	12	Oh, ok.	
41	12		I didn't know the horse or body supposed to be right here or here.
41	12	Ok. And what about this piece where do you think we should try this one.	
41	12		That's, I like that duck because that, that's a baby duck.
41	12	Yeah? So where do you think this baby duck should go.	
41	12		It should go with the water.
41	12	Ok, do you have a guess where it should go in the water?	
41	12		I don't know where's the water.
41	12	You don't know yet?	
41	12	Should we wait, we'll save it for later?	
41	12		Yeah, we can wait.
41	12	Ok.	
41	12		Yeah we can wait, if you see the water we can put in it.
41	12	In the water? Ok.	
41	12	What about this piece where do you think this one should go.	
41	12		Um, it should go, mm…
41	12		Because I see the pony's tail.
41	12	Mhm.	
41	12		So where we put, I don't know where we put the pony's tail.
41	12	Think it goes there?	
41	12		I think it goes here.
41	12	Think it goes there?	
41	12		We gotta wait for this one.
41	12	We gotta wait for that one too?	
41	12	Well what about if we do this.	
41	12		What if you do that?
41	12	Yeah.	
41	12	Where do you think this piece should go.	
41	12		It should go, hm, it should go right here.
41	12	Right there? You think it goes there?	
41	12		It should go somewhere.
41	12		It should go right here.
41	12	Right there? Does that look like it matches there?	
41	12		Um, the pony's, um, the pony's um
41	12		This don't go there, this don't go there.
41	12		Gotta wait for this one.
41	12	We gotta wait for that one too?	
41	12	Well what if we do this.	
41	12		Oh.
41	12	Does that look like it matches?	
41	12	Ok now do you have a guess where we could put this one?	
41	12	Can you use your words and tell me where to put it?	
41	12		I think we should put it right here.
41	12	How'd you know that piece would go there?	
41	12		Uh-huh.
41	12	How'd you figure that out?	
41	12		I tried.
41	12	You tried it?

41	12	The duck?	
41	12		The duck is right here.
41	12	Ok. What about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where we should try it?	
41	12		Mhm.
41	12	Where do you think it should go.	
41	12		It should go right here.
41	12	Right here like this?	
41	12		It should go right…
41	12	There?	
41	12		It should go um… right umm…
41	12		I don't know where this go.
41	12	You don't know?	
41	12	Should we save it for later?	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12	Ok we'll save it.	
41	12		We can wait to that later.
41	12	What about this piece?	
41	12		It's supposed to go right here.
41	12	So go here like this?	
41	12		No.
41	12	No? How could we tell that's wrong?	
41	12		That's wrong.
41	12		Oh, I know.
41	12	Oh, how'd you know that piece would go there?	
41	12		A sun out and the face go right here.
41	12	The face goes right here? Ok.	
41	12		And there's the sunshine.
41	12	The sunshine, yeah.	
41	12	So what about this piece, do we have a guess where this one could go yet?	
41	12		Mm.
41	12	Where do you think.	
41	12		I want to try.
41	12	You wanna try it? Where are we gonna try it.	
41	12		I try this
41	12	Does it go right there?	
41	12		It don't go right there.
41	12	How could we tell it doesn't go there?	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12	How could we tell that's wrong?	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12		I see the pieces, but
41	12	But they don't fit?	
41	12		I think we got I think we can't move these puzzles because this is in the way.
41	12	Ok.	
41	12		But we don't have to move these puzzles we gotta wait for this one.
41	12	Wait for that piece? Ok.	
41	12	What about this piece you have a guess where this one should go?	
41	12	Where, where do you think it should go.	
41	12		This should go right here.
41	12	Right there?	
41	12		Or right here.
41	12		Or right… here.
41	12	Does it go there?	
41	12		Yeah. This one don't go right there.
41	12	It doesn't go there?	
41	12	How could we tell it doesn't go there?	
41	12		Well some pieces go right here because you like the pieces together
41	12	What about this piece where do you think we should try this one.	
41	12		We should try this one um we should
41	12	Right there?	
41	12		Um, I think it go right here.
41	12	Goes there?	
41	12		Yeah, no.

41	12		I think it's… I think this don't go right here.
41	12	Ok we should save it?	
41	12		Some of these go right here
41	12	Yeah? Well what if we try this piece here?	
41	12	Does that work? Yeah.	
41	12	What about this piece, can you use your words and tell me where we should try it?	
41	12		It go with the cow.

41	12		Yeah
41	12	Does that look right?	
41	12		I think.
41	12		Where's this one?

41	12	Over there.	
41	12	It's for the heat.	
41	12		The heat coming out.
41	12	Yeah.	
41	12	Ok so do you have another guess where that piece could go.	
41	12		I think it go right here but
41	12	You think it goes there?	
41	12		No.
41	12	No?	
41	12		It got two points on them.
41	12	Two points on it?	
41	12	So where do you think it should go?	
41	12		It should go, um, we gotta wait for this turn.
41	12	Wait for it too?	
41	12		It's supposed to be with the pig.
41	12	Supposed to be with the pig?	
41	12		But I don't know where this go.
41	12	You don't know?	
41	12		Not go right here.
41	12	Why do you think it goes with the pig?	
41	12		Because I see the pig's whole body.
41	12	Oh, there we go.	
41	12	Good job, how'd you know that piece had to go like that.	
41	12		Because I saw his legs.
41	12	You saw his legs, ok.	
41	12	What about this piece, do you have a guess for this one yet?	
41	12		This one…
41	12	There you go.	
41	12	How'd you know that piece would go there?	
41	12		I see the cow whole body because
41	12	The cow's whole body?	
41	12		Go right…
41	12	What about this piece?	
41	12	Where should we put that one.	
41	12		Goes… hm…
41	12		What, I don't know where this go.
41	12	I think it might go there.	
41	12		Think it go right…
41	12	Does it go right here?	
41	12		Think so.
41	12	Let's see what could we do to that piece to make it fit there.	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12		It got two points on there.
41	12	Two points on there too?	
41	12	Well what if we put those points like this.	
41	12	Will it fit like that?	
41	12		Yeah.
41	12	There we go.	
41	12	And what about our last piece.	
41	12	There we go, good job.	
42	12	We're gonna play a game with my friend puzzle, ok.	
42	12	So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna do the puzzle but you're gonna tell me how.	
42	12	So I stack all the pieces of the puzzle and you're gonna tell me where they go and I'm gonna put them in.	
42	12	And I'm only gonna only do what you tell me to ok?

42	12	I'm only gonna do what you tell me so be sure to tell me, use your words ok?	
42	12	What do you-what should I do with this one?	
42	12		Mm, put it up in the sky.
42	12	Up in the sky? Like here?	
42	12	Yeah?	
42	12	Scoot it over, ok.	
42	12	What about this one? Where should I put it?

42	12		Right here the barn goes barn.
42	12	Ok.	
42	12		Yeah.
42	12	Now where should this one go.	
42	12		Oh that's where the horsey goes.
42	12	So where should I put it?	
42	12		I think by the horsey.
42	12	Where by the horsey?	
42	12		Look at that. Right there.
42	12	You want me to try right there?	
42	12	Like that?

42	12		Yeah.
42	12		Ah, there.
42	12	Like that?

42	12	Where does this one go?	
42	12		That's so… I see the piggy. Where's the pig?
42	12		Where is that piggy?
42	12		Oh, wait a second.
42	12	Where should I put this piece?	
42	12	See it?	
42	12		Yeah.
42	12	Where do you think I should try it?	
42	12	I can try it anywhere, where do you want me to try it?	
42	12		I'm thinking here.
42	12	Here?	
42	12		Here.
42	12	Like that?	
42	12		No.
42	12	No? How?

42	12	It didn't fit there, remember?	
42	12		Yeah I remember.

42	12		No.
42	12		Wait a second.
